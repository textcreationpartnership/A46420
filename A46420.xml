            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>DEcimus Junius Juvenalis</hi> was born of wealthy Parents at <hi>Aquinum,</hi> a City of the <hi>Volſci.</hi> Till his middle age he uſed, according to the cuſtome of thoſe times, to Declame, though more for his own Content, then for any intention to prepare himſelf either for Schools or Law-Courts. Afterwards ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying his mind to Poetry, particularly Satyres, though at the firſt he feared to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to any great Auditory, yet he quickly found great encreaſe of Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and Fame. Upon which encouragement, inſerting into his later Compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome of his firſt ſharp lines, as namely that, <hi>Sat.</hi> 7. <hi>Praefectos Pelopaea facit, Philomela tribunos,</hi> wherein he ſeem'd to touch one <hi>Paris</hi> a Player, ſo ſtrangely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Emperor <hi>Domitian,</hi> that he could procure for his Friends Military Offices; his jeſt was in his old Age made his puniſhment, he being ſent into <hi>Aegypt</hi> by way of an honorary Service with a Military Command, the Vertue and Fame of the Man awing his adverſaries from farther Revenge. But this disfavour he long out-lived, reaching into part of <hi>Adrians</hi> raign. That he lived to be an old Man, he himſelf implies, <hi>Sat.</hi> 11. where he ſays of himſelf and of <hi>Perſius,</hi> to whom he writes, <hi>Noſtra bibat vernum contracia cuticula ſolem, Effugiatque togam</hi>—. For his <hi>Perſon,</hi> ſome deſcribe him to have been of a large Stature; and Antiquity has left unto us this Portraiture of him.</p>

                  <p>For the Ability and Manner of his Life, though he reckons not himſelf among the Wealthy, ſaying of himſelf, <hi>Sat.</hi> 12. <hi>Si res ampla domi ſimiliſque affectibus eſſet:</hi> yet <hi>Sat.</hi> 11. he deſcribes his Country-houſe, his Cheer, his Attendants, which argue a ſufficient Plenty to ſo wiſe a Mind. There is no mention that he was ever Married, nor is it probable; if we conſider his belief of the VVomen of that Age! For his acquaintance, beſides <hi>Vmbritius</hi> a famous <hi>Aruſpex</hi> (mention'd, <hi>Sat.</hi> 3.) and others, he was ſingularly belov'd and reſpected by <hi>Martial</hi> the Poet, as his Epigrams teſtifie: prais'd alſo by <hi>Quintilian,</hi> in his Oratory Inſtitutions, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. as the chief of Satyriſts. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 28. <hi>Hiſtor.</hi>) Says, that ſome who did deteſt Learning, did notwithſtanding in their moſt profound retiredneſs, diligently employ themſelves in his Works. To omit <hi>Suidas</hi> and ſome other of the Ancients which mention him, <hi>Porphyrio</hi> the Commentator on <hi>Horace,</hi> confeſſes that <hi>Horace</hi> had excelled, had not <hi>Juvenal</hi> written. And this has been the judgment, alſo of the famous <hi>Scaligers, Rigaltius</hi> and others: but the learned <hi>Heinſius</hi> has in this compariſon oppoſed his Fame. VVhoſe cheif ground is in effect this, that according to the ancient art and law of Satyre, it ſhould be nearer the Comedy, then the Tragedy, not declaiming againſt Vice, but jeering at it. Which though he proves with much Learning, yet this reaches but to the ancient Satyre: which way, it is apparent <hi>Juvenal</hi> underſtood, and in part left. Satyre was for a time a jeer, but it was but for a time: and what Poems have not with time much alter'd their faſhion? which alteration is to after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times as good warrant as the firſt. Beſides, <hi>Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Perſius</hi> were not of <hi>Horace</hi> his judgment, for their choice: for though they had ſeen his Satyres, yet they choſe this form, not ſo much like a Flout, as a Declamation. <hi>Perſius</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that <hi>Horace</hi> jeer'd, ſaying <hi>Circum praecordia ludit,</hi> and —<hi>vitium — ridenti amico Tangit,</hi> and terming him <hi>Vafer Flaccus;</hi> but ſpeaking of <hi>Lucilius</hi> he ſayes, <hi>ſecuit—urbem,</hi> and <hi>genuinum fregit in illis:</hi> which was plainly to take notice of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent forms of Satyre before him. And does not <hi>Juvenal</hi> the like? Does he not profeſs, that he was provoked to this way of writing, ſaying, —<hi>quis tam ferreus, ut teneat ſe?</hi> Does he not profeſs the Cauſe and Degree of the Provocation, whiles he ſays, <hi>Omne in praecipiti vitium ſtetit—?</hi> Does he not alſo defend his way, his Zeal of ſtile, by ſome precedents of former times, asking —<hi>

                        </gap>nde illa priorum Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi quodcunque animo flagrante liceret Simplicitas—?</hi> Does he not more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly defend himſelf by <hi>Lucilius</hi> his example, his fierce example, as he expreſſes it ſaying, <hi>Enſe velut ſtricto quoties Lucilius ardens Infremuit—?</hi> We may not confine free Spirits to one form: the Body not admitting ſuch ſervitude from Apparel. As for ſuch particular exceptions, againſt our Author, as ſeem'd more conſiderable, I have in their own places delivered my own Opinion without the prejudice of Truth and Liberty. But for the general defence and compariſon of our Author, the praiſes, ſhall I ſay, yea the Reaſons alleadged by ſome will be found weighty. The Elder <hi>Scaliger</hi> calls <hi>Horace</hi> a Scoffer, his Speech vulgar, his Verſe negligent, only his <hi>Latin</hi> pure. But <hi>Juvenal,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ardet, inſtat, aperte jugulat;</hi> his Purity is <hi>Roman,</hi> his Compoſure happy, his Verſe better, his Sentences ſharper, his Phraſe more open, his Satyre more accurate. <hi>Horace</hi> did not more exceed <hi>Lucilius,</hi> then <hi>Juvenal Horace;</hi> whether we reſpect the variety of Arguments, the dexterity of handling, the plenty of invention, the frequency of ſentences, the ſharpneſs of reprehenſion, or the urbanity of the quippe. In the ſame Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments <hi>Juvenal</hi> never came ſhort of him, often out-went him; <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s eighth Satyre of true Nobility is far more excellent, then, of the ſame argument, <hi>Horace</hi> his Sixth. Compare <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Tenth with <hi>Horace</hi> his Firſt, of the Deſires of Men,
<pb facs="tcp:62892:4"/>(let <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> ſpeak the cloſe in his own words) <hi>ſane ille tibi Juvenalis poeta videbitur, hic Horatius jejunae cujuſpiam theſeos tenuis tentator;</hi> ſurely thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <hi>Juvenal</hi> to be a Poet, but <hi>Horace</hi> to be ſome poor Theme-maker. The quick <hi>Lipſius</hi> readily approves this approbation, ſaying of <hi>Scaliger, Ille me judice inter multa certi &amp; elegantis judicii nihil verius protulit;</hi> preferring him before <hi>Horace,</hi> for his Ardor, his Loftineſs, his Liberty. And for my own part, though I willingly admire his felicity in his <hi>Lyricks,</hi> yet certainly I believe he injuriouſly untun'd himſelf in his fall from the <hi>Ode</hi> to the <hi>Satyre.</hi> Beſides, <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s change of the ancient Satyre was, methinks, not only a Change, but a Perfection. For, what is the End of Satyre, but to Reform? whereas a perpetual Grin does rather Anger then Mend. Wherefore the Old Satyre and the New, and ſo <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Juvenal,</hi> may ſeem to differ as the Jeſter and the Orator, the Face of an Ape and of a Man, or as the Fiddle and Thunder. We willingly allow unto <hi>Horace</hi> the nature of Satyre, as it was in his own time, gentle, according to that of <hi>Lipſius</hi> of him, <hi>monet ſaepius quàm caſtigat:</hi> nor conceal the Elogy which he adds, <hi>Sed ita praeclare tamen hoc ipſum: ut in ea parte &amp; arte nihil poſsit ſupra eum.</hi> Yet this amounts but to an art of <hi>admonition,</hi> not the bravery of <hi>Chaſtiſement;</hi> for which, in his Heat and Height, and Freedom, <hi>id eſt, ſuo quodam genere</hi> (ſays the ſame Author) <hi>ſupra Horatium eſt: quod ipſum maxime Satyrae proprium videtur.</hi> VVherefore I judge the Learned <hi>Rigaltius</hi> his Judgment and Diſtinction to be accurate: who ſays that <hi>Horace</hi> is jeering, and ſo fit for <hi>Auguſtus</hi> his times; <hi>Perſius</hi> grave, and ſo more fit for leud <hi>Nero</hi>'s days; and <hi>Juvenal</hi> Terrible, and ſo moſt fit for <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian</hi>'s deſperate Age. He denies alſo any (ſuppoſed) exceſs of words in his 13th Satyre, making his enumeration of the Gods but a needful expreſſion of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd fictions of their ſeveral Gods, whom he every where flouts-at, ſeeming to make Exact Nature his God! A happy man, had he aſcended to the right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the God of Nature! <hi>Naevolus</hi> likewiſe (<hi>Sat.</hi> 9.) he accounts here no fouler, then in <hi>Arnobius</hi> (<hi>Diſput.</hi> 5.) the deſcription of the <hi>Grecian Ithyphallica:</hi> beſides, that by ſhame men are naturally driven from acts of ſhame. Yet what openneſs of Speech has in this kind been uſed by <hi>Juvenal,</hi> I have in my rendring of him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd rather to correct, then excuſe: both commending the wiſdom of <hi>Rader</hi> and ſome others, and fixing it for a Rule unto my ſelf, that Better it is a Book ſhould be loſt, then a Man. Nor do I approve the unhappy Induſtry of ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters of our Author, <hi>Britannicus</hi> and <hi>Lubin</hi> (to omit others) who think they expound nothing at all, if they expound not All: but I ſhall always think it an unhappy praiſe, to be accounted a better <hi>Grammarian,</hi> then a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of <hi>Petrus Colvius</hi> (as Fame informs us) is not to be forgotten; whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wit did learnedly expound <hi>Apuleius</hi> his Aſſe: but having been too diligent in expounding as much his Beaſtlineſs, as his Sport, a very Aſſe gave him his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. For as on a time he was in a Journey, coming into an Inne, an Aſſe which was there taking ſome caſual offence, unhappily ſtriking at him, kill'd him in the place. But (if we ſet aſide this Licence) and look upon the Invention of our Poet, though a Natural man, O how admirable are his Inſtructions? His Paſſions how Devout? What are his Satyres, but the Great Commentary of Nature upon the Law of Nature? The <hi>Multitude of Gods</hi> does he not count a Multitude (<hi>Sat.</hi> 13.) making them as deſtitute of Wiſdom, as of Power? A <hi>God in Statue</hi> does he not confeſs to be the Artificers Creature, and Mighty <hi>Mars</hi> (<hi>Sat.</hi> 13.) to be ſo ſilly, or weak, as to be robbed of his own weapons? The <hi>variety of their Oaths,</hi> does he not deſcribe and deteſt, as the variety of their Gods (<hi>Sat.</hi> 13.) ſhewing how they would excuſe themſelves out of one guilt by another? <hi>Set days of divine
<pb facs="tcp:62892:5"/>worſhip</hi> to the Author of them, does he not acknowledge, whiles he reprehends the ſuperſtition in the performance of it (<hi>Sat.</hi> 6.) Indeed a Beaſt is but an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from the Earth; but Time is a preſent from Heaven it ſelf: That is a part of our Goods; This of our Life. The <hi>Duty to a Father,</hi> yea but to a Beard, does not his Gravity Deſerve, whiles he Deſcribes it? The Duty <hi>from</hi> a Father does he not ſo excellently ſet-out (<hi>Sat.</hi> 14.) that by the Art of Inſtruction, he makes himſelf the honeſt Father of other mens Children? <hi>Bloody Out-rage</hi> does he not deteſt with ſuch wounding compaſſion (<hi>Sat.</hi> 15.) as if he would make the Murderer execute himſelf with Remorſe? Againſt the foul flames of <hi>Luſt</hi> are not the pure flames of his Zeal oppoſed, to ſhame them by Diſſimilitude (<hi>Sat.</hi> 6.) and with a more happy ſeparation, then once were thoſe of the <hi>Theban</hi> Brothers? Againſt Barren Luſt (<hi>Sat.</hi> 9.) is not his Wit Fruitful? Oppreſſion, <hi>Rapine,</hi> Couſenage, (<hi>Sat.</hi> 1.8.13.) are they not as far from his Boſome, as their Booty from his Hand? As if unjuſt Increaſe were not Wealth, but Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and a ſad exchange of Innocence for Gold. Againſt the cowardly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencing of true <hi>Witneſs,</hi> (<hi>Sat.</hi> 16.) is he not ſtoutly Eloquent? And would he not rather burn in <hi>Perillus</hi> his Bull, (<hi>Sat.</hi> 8.) then have the guilt of Perjury burn in his Breaſt, (<hi>Sat.</hi> 13.)? The very Purpoſe, nay the Deliberating <hi>Deſire of Sin,</hi> (<hi>Sat.</hi> 13.) before it is grown up to the Age of Act, does he not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, and by endeavor Prevent? And like an exact <hi>Caſuiſt</hi> (<hi>Sat.</hi> 13.) does he not make <hi>Conſcience</hi> Man's Keeper and <hi>Judge?</hi> O that we could Argue him into a Chriſtian! And yet if Friendſhip can make it probable, we may pleaſe our ſelves with a hope at the endeavor of ſuch, as would prove that <hi>Martial,</hi> our Poets intimate Friend, in his later age Reviv'd into Chriſtianity. And could their Loves communicate leſs joys, and ſtand at diſtance in the Greateſt? But howſoever ſeeing that among the Heathen God raiſed-up ſo excellent an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructer, was it not pitty, the Inſtruction ſhould be either not underſtood, or miſunderſtood? Eſpecially when ſome diſdainful ſinners, that are unhappily leſs ſenſible of Chriſtian motives, may peradventure ſtartle at the ſpur of a Heathen. Wherefore in Hope and Zeal I ventur'd on this work, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that a man may, not without ſucceſs, though without cuſtome, Preach in Verſe. VVhich purpoſe being underſtood by ſome worthy friends, was not condemn'd but incourag'd by a free and happy ſupply of diverſe excellent Manuſcripts of our Author. My honour'd friend Mr. <hi>John Selden</hi> (of ſuch eminency in the Studies of Antiquities and Languages) and Mr. <hi>Fanaby</hi> (whoſe learned Induſtry ſpeaks much for him in a little) procur'd me a fair Manuſcript Copy from the famous Library at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, and a Manuſcript Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary from our Herald of Learning, Mr. <hi>Cambden.</hi> My dear friend, the Patriarch of our Poets, <hi>Ben. Johnſon</hi> ſent-in alſo an ancient Manuſcript partly written in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Character. My learned friend Dr. <hi>Merick Cauſabon</hi> afforded like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe an elegant Manuſcript from the Study of his exact Father. The ready and ſingular courteſie of Dr. <hi>Anyan</hi> ſometime Preſident, and the Fellows, of <hi>Corpus-Chriſti</hi>-Colledge, lent me from their publick Library a large and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Manuſcript. My ancient friend Mr. <hi>Thomas Allen,</hi> the perpetual Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Gloceſter-Hall,</hi> yielded me alſo a parcel of a Manuſcript, the firſt three Satyres. Nor may I omit my ingenuous and learned friend Dr. <hi>John Price,</hi> who imparted to me divers forreign Criticks, whoſe Labours, though publiſh'd, are but rarely brought into theſe parts, but collected by his diligent choice, in his Travels into <hi>France, Italy,</hi> and <hi>Greece:</hi> to which I added mine own ſtore, and what choice ones my youth had obſerved in our <hi>Oxford</hi>-Library.
<pb facs="tcp:62892:5"/>With this preparation I entered on this task; ſtudying to make my Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion firſt True, next as free from Annotations, as the Argument would permit. But the work implying ſuch plenty of Antiquities, I had wronged both the Work and the Reader had I left them in darkneſs. Illuſtrations therefore grew neceſſary: wherein, beſides the Manuſcripts, I perus'd the moſt judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Commentaries, cheifly of the <hi>Scholiaſt, Britannicus, Lubin,</hi> and <hi>Autumnus:</hi> to whom I added the cheif Antiquaries and Criticks, (which in my ſearch I had lighted on) who in other labours had occaſionally touch'd upon our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Concerning whoſe opinions I have deliver'd mine own with ſuch inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous liberty, as I ſuppoſe they uſed; leaving it to the like judge, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Judgment. As for publiſhing Poetry, it needs no defence; there being a Divine rapture in it, if my Lord of <hi>Verulam</hi>'s judgment ſhall be admitted. To which I may adde, that Majeſty has not deſpis'd it, witneſs <hi>David,</hi> and our good <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, whoſe Royal wit writ a Comedy, as our <hi>Bate</hi> tells us, witneſs <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and the Learned <hi>Proſper:</hi> whoſe Compoſitions are their own Praiſe and our Delight. Witneſs <hi>Petrarch,</hi> Arch-deacon of <hi>Parma,</hi> and (one of mine one Predeceſſors) <hi>Walter Mapes</hi> ſometime Arch-deacon of <hi>Oxford;</hi> a witty Satyriſt, and a Favourite to our great <hi>Henry</hi> the Second: nay, witneſs the profound wit of <hi>Macchiavel,</hi> who has left unto us his pleaſant Plots, as well in <hi>(Italian)</hi> Comedy, as in Diſcourſe. And for the ſtudy of Antiquities in the expreſſion of human Authors, witneſs the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Torrentius, Antonius Auguſtinus,</hi> and of <hi>Euſlathius</hi> in former times; men of high honour in the Chriſtian Church. And now after all my labour I would not delude my ſelf with more Joy, then Succeſs: nor with <hi>Egyptian</hi> vanity take up a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the finding of a quick Idol inſteed of a Deity; and had rather not be, then be a <hi>Suffenus.</hi> I acknowledge then our Author to be of more difficulties, then any other, which <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> can ſhew; of greater difficulties then they can ſhew: nor will I, whiles I ſay ſo, fear to remember <hi>Lycophron</hi>'s Propheteſs, nor <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Mantle. Some paſſages will prove this, being lyable to a manifold, a ten-fold Expoſition; yet every one to a Reader not very Intentive very probable; that we may ſay, the <hi>Delphick</hi> Oracle was leſs Riddle. Yet I think the difficulties in <hi>Perſius</hi> and <hi>Juvenal</hi> to have a difference: the trouble in <hi>Perſius</hi> being to Find a meaning; in <hi>Juvenal</hi> to Chooſe it. If therefore we ſometimes miſs, (Error being as poſſible, as a Hair in the Pen) we will yet ſuſtain our ſelves (but after juſt induſtry) with the frailty of ſome great ones, who in their ſearch of the Quadrature of the Circle have been eminent for Wit and Miſtake. Yet have I not over-leap'd the hardeſt places: not preſum'd to place in my Tranſlation an opinion, though the beſt, without giving a reaſon in the Illuſtrations, leaſt otherwiſe with Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Suſpicion it might be ask'd, Sir, how came you by this Choice? In equity therefore I give an Account, and endeavor not to fail in the <hi>Arithmetick.</hi> To which circumſpection I am the rather mov'd from that ſevere <hi>Caution</hi> of our admirable Inſtructer in the Laws (in his Preface to the ſixth part of his <hi>Reports</hi>) <hi>Every man that writes ought to be ſo careful of ſetting down truth, as if the credit of his whole work conſiſted upon the certainty of every particular period.</hi> So that had not an ancient Promiſe, a Love of Truth, and a Self-juſtice to tranſmit a right Copy of my endeavors to after-times prevail'd with me, I had not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd them, but ſuppreſs'd them. But upon theſe motives, intending about ten years ſince to have publiſh'd them, a new inconvenience befel them, my tranſlation of the firſt Five Satyres being at that time borrow'd of me by an
<pb facs="tcp:62892:6"/>eſpecial Friend, and accidentally paſſing farther into other hands, then by me intended; a Tranſlation of theſe Satyres by another, ſome few months after, appear'd in Print. Yet having ſeen divers parts of this Author formerly render'd and publiſh'd by divers, as other Authors in the like kind, as <hi>Ovid,</hi> and <hi>Lucan</hi> by others, and anciently <hi>David</hi>'s Devotions, by <hi>Eobanus, Beza, Buchanan,</hi> every one having the choice of his own ſtudies: in a like freedom, after diverſe and neceſſary delays, though perchance, Reader, without thy loſs, I have at laſt been perſuaded to be ſo hardy, as to preſent youth in age. Indeed <hi>Horace</hi> injoyns the ſuppreſſion of a Poem thrice three years, as if he would, methinks, have every one of the Muſes to paſs her judgment on it. The judicious <hi>Scriverius</hi> having written learned Notes upon <hi>Martial,</hi> ſuppreſs'd them, as he himſelf tells us, thrice five years. The famous <hi>Italian</hi> Fable-weaver <hi>Arioſto,</hi> was by the rude diſcourteſie of Law-ſuites diſturb'd in the pleaſure of his Phanſie twice ſeven years: all which, with the overwhelming Calamities of late times, may ſufficiently excuſe either the Neceſſity or the Choice of my Delay. Not will I now ſeek to eternize my work by the way and phanſie of Old <hi>Ennius,</hi> who ended his Poem with <hi>Acroſticks,</hi> which ſaid, as <hi>Cicero</hi> tells us, <hi>Q. Ennius fecit:</hi> or with the like device of <hi>Gulielmus Canterus,</hi> in the cloſe of his Tranſlation of <hi>Lycophron:</hi> or with a like Crochet to that of the voluminous <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Muſitian, <hi>Cerone,</hi> who cloſes his work with ſeveral ſentences beginning with the Muſical Notes, Ut, Re, Mi, Fa, Sol, La. They that like ſuch Muſick, may for me en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure their pleaſure: for my part, I had rather excuſe, then Triumph (though I think both but vain, yet both in uſe); and in the modeſty of the old <hi>Romans</hi> in ſomewhat a like caſe, deliver my opinion in ſome paſſages of the work, by a Lot inſcrib'd with NL.</p>

The <hi>Romans</hi> at the firſt, called their repaſt at Noon, <hi>Merenda;</hi> and uſed to faſt from that time till Supper: but afterwards Luxury encreaſing amongſt them, they thought it too much to faſt ſo long, and therefore made another meal between; then calling that meal <hi>Prandium,</hi> which before was called <hi>Merenda,</hi> and beſtowing this name <hi>Merenda</hi> on the new repaſt, which their delicacy invented. Yet <hi>Andreas Baccius, de Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viis Antiquorum, lib.</hi> 4. hath a conceit, though he denies not the former Etymologie of <hi>Merenda;</hi> thinking that it may be equally called ſo a <hi>Merendo,</hi> and ſo that it properly ſignified the repaſt of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers; which for conceit we may commend, whiles we approve <hi>Manutius</hi> his Opinion for Truth.

Their third, <hi>Merenda,</hi> bears apt proportion to our After-noon <hi>Bever,</hi> or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Their fourth, <hi>Coena,</hi> (called alſo <hi>Veſperna</hi>) anſwered to our <hi>Supper.</hi> Their fift, <hi>Commeſſatio,</hi> was a Drinking about two or three hours after Supper. All theſe were uſed by the luxurious; but the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate were content with few. Break-faſts were ſcarce uſed by any but Children: Dinners likewiſe were made a full meal only by Them, as too tender to endure hunger, and by Labourers, in whom the repair of ſtrength makes food more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. The better ſort, if they dined at al, did it but ſlightly. The <hi>Merenda</hi> was required by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Labourers, and the tenderneſs of Children. Their <hi>Coena</hi> was the only meal which the better ſort uſually made; and unto This were their moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected Invitations. Their <hi>Commeſſatio</hi> was by the Riotous often abuſed: but the learned made it the occaſion of enjoying each others vertue and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by diſcourſe.

Some would have it to ſignifie one extreamly effeminate; as <hi>Baptiſta Pius,</hi> in his <hi>Annot.

But this is but opinion and an imagin'd ſignification of the word. <hi>Tully</hi> indeed does by that word diſgrace <hi>Antonie,</hi> yet not by that expreſs his riot, but his baſe oppreſſion, to which his riot, whiles he was in thoſe parts, did drive him. For he being a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to maintain his luxury, as it were perform the office of the <hi>Arabarches,</hi> or <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Publican, which was too vile a practice for his Nobilitie. To expreſs then the nature of the office and the reaſon of the name, it may be obſerved, that in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces ſubject to the <hi>Romans</hi> there were Officers, which received the cuſtome and paid it to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> treaſury; and that particularly in <hi>Aegypt</hi> there was a great cuſtome paid for the cattle, which were yearly brought into that country from <hi>Arabia;</hi> and that this Cuſtomer for this reſpect was proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called <hi>Arabarches;</hi> as may be collected from <hi>Rhodigin. Lection. Antiq. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. Conſent of Copies having it thus, it is not lighty to be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. The Office then of a Publican and Cuſtomer, though at the firſt it was of good credit, yet as at the firſt it had the Occaſion, ſo at the laſt the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Baſeneſs. See <hi>Waſerus de antiquis numis He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braorum, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. But now it is to be enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who is to be underſtood by this <hi>Arabarches.</hi> The common opinion hitherto has been, that <hi>Criſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus</hi> was the man; but <hi>Prolemaeus Flavius</hi> (in his <hi>conjectan. cap.</hi> 49.) ſeems to have obſerved, (for he poſitively affirmes) that He had not a ſtatùe: and he being cut-out, he ſayes, that the man here underſtood is <hi>Joſephus</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi> who for his worth, ſays he, had a ſtatue erected to him, which, as he adds, our Poet took in great indignation, and therefore ſatyrically deſcribes him ſaying, that he knew not whether he were a baſe <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> or an effeminate <hi>Arabian,</hi> meaning by an excluſive ſcorn, a third thing as vile, a <hi>Jew.</hi> But againſt this witty opinion we may ſuppoſe theſe reaſons; Firſt, the ingenuity of our Poet: for although <hi>Joſephus</hi> was a <hi>Jew</hi> and ſo by country odious, yet being eminent for learning and wiſdom, our Author probably would be far from jeering at ſuch worth. Secondly, <hi>Joſephus</hi> never had the office of the <hi>Arabarches.</hi> Thirdly, this interpretation cannot ſtand without a manifeſt corruption of the text: for then it ſhould be read with the particle of diviſion, <hi>Aegyptius aut Arabarches;</hi> which is falſe, as, in the reaſon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, it appears. Fourthly the Poet does not ſay, he knows not <hi>whether</hi> he were an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> or an <hi>Arabian;</hi> but not <hi>what Aegyptian,</hi> or an uncertain one, the text being not <hi>An Aegyptius,</hi> but <hi>Quis.</hi> The perſon then here underſtood was one <hi>Tiberius Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> by birth an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> who for embracing at that time the religion of the <hi>Romans,</hi> was highly honour'd and made Prefect of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> as <hi>Tacitus</hi> affirmes in his <hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 1. and was afterwards a prime agent to help <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> to the Empire, as <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citus</hi> ſhews, <hi>Hiſt. lib.</hi> 2. and he had a ſtatue, as <hi>Biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciola</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Hor. ſubſeciv. lib.</hi> 14. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. So that by this double mark <hi>Aegyptius atque Arabarches</hi> (for that is true reading, <hi>atque</hi> not <hi>aut,</hi> according to the Manuſcripts which I uſe) our Poet right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaryrically points him out. Where this caution may be taken by the way; that ſeing that <hi>Tiberius Alexander</hi> was the <hi>Arabarches,</hi> it is not without a ſlip expounded by ſome by <hi>Arabiae Praefectus:</hi> for at what time <hi>Tiberius Alexander</hi> had this prefecture of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> there was no Prefect of <hi>Arabia: Arabia</hi> being not conquer'd to the quiet obedience of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire till <hi>Trajan</hi>'s time (as it is manifeſt by <hi>Lazius de Rep.

The <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> takes it according to the ſecond, for a ſtudy; ſo likewiſe <hi>Britannicus:</hi> who, though the opinion be in a ſort true, illuſtrates it ill from that of <hi>Perſius, Nec pluteum caedit;</hi> as if the Poet had there implied, that Poets, when their compoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not eaſy but with violence, us'd to knock their knuckles againſt their ſtudie-walls. But the whole difficulty may be beſt removed, by taking notice of the cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> who orderd ſeveral ſorts of Images into ſeveral places. The firſt of which was before their <hi>Gates;</hi> where they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Images of their Anceſtours expreſſed in <hi>braſs,</hi> or ſuch ſolid matter. The ſecond was in their <hi>Halls,</hi> as in a conſpicuous part of their houſe: and here they ſet the like ſtatues but curiouſly wrought in <hi>waxe.</hi> The third was in their <hi>Chamber,</hi> where they placed their <hi>Lares</hi> (for the careful keeping of which a ſervant was appointed) then the Images of thoſe friends, whom they lov'd moſt dearly; as alſo the Deities, which had the care of the Marriage bed. The <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors in latter times kept here alſo a golden Image of <hi>Fortune:</hi> yet <hi>Domitian</hi> had not an Image of <hi>Fortune,</hi> but of <hi>Minerva;</hi> as, before him, <hi>Tully</hi> alſo had. The fourth place was their <hi>pinacotheca;</hi> by compariſon of the uſe we may call it a <hi>gallerie of pictures:</hi> and in this they placed the repreſentations of their Gods and their <hi>Heroës,</hi> and likewiſe painted fables and hiſtories. The fift and laſt was their <hi>ſtudy,</hi> wherein they kept the Images of <hi>Learned men.</hi> Of which two laſt that place of <hi>Lampridius</hi> may ſeem properly to be underſtood in his <hi>Alexand.</hi> where he ſpeaks of the Emperor's two-fold <hi>Lararium:</hi> in the one of which, he ſays, he had the Images of <hi>Apollonius, Abraham</hi> and <hi>Orpheus;</hi> and this agrees with the uſe of their <hi>pinacotheca:</hi> in the other he ſays, he had the Images of <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Tully;</hi> and this agrees with the propertie of their <hi>bibliatheca,</hi> or ſtudy. By this then we may avoid the error of <hi>Calderine,</hi> who ſays, that <hi>pluteus</hi> here ſignifies <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacotheca;</hi> for proof alleging that of <hi>Pliny, Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cothecas veteribus tabulis conſumunt,</hi> as he reads it,

For ſince the Images of learned men were kept only in their ſtudies, not in their galleries; and that <hi>pluteus,</hi> according to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſignifies the place, where ſuch Images were kept; it follows, that <hi>pluteus</hi> here cannot fignifie <hi>pinacotheca,</hi> but <hi>bibliotheca.</hi> That place of <hi>Pliny</hi> ſhews only, that in their <hi>pinacotheca</hi> they kept Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but that they were not of learned men, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the diſtinction of places.

The Coated <hi>Gracchus</hi>'s trident This ſurpaſs'd. <hi>Tunicati fuſcina Gracchi.</hi> Under the name of <hi>Grac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> the Poet here and before declames againſt ſome of the cheif Nobility; before for their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable marriages, and here for hiring their lives to the <hi>Prator</hi> (who ſet forth ſhews to the people) and, as infamous perſons, for fighting publickly in the <hi>Amphitheater</hi> ſtrew'd with ſand, to drink up the blood that was ſhed. For they that were put to the worſt were according to the cuſtome uſually killed: yet to this baſe madneſs did ſome of the vicious and bank-rupt Nobilitie deſcend. Where it is worth the noting, that the Poet, in paſſing to the deſcription of this other <hi>Gracchus,</hi> ſays <hi>Vicit &amp;c hoc monſtrum tunicati fuſcina Gracchi,</hi> as if this fault had been more monſtrous then the other crime. Which ſenſe may ſeem unworthy of <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s judgement, namely that he ſhould make a fault againſt Honour to be greater then a ſin againſt Nature; and I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail that this inconvenience has almoſt ſcaped all Interpreters. Indeed <hi>Lubin</hi> ſeems to take notice of it, ſaying that the Poet calls this the worſe fault, becauſe unto the former, ſome of the Nobilitic had been forced by <hi>Nero,</hi> but unto This baſeneſs they did voluntarily deſcend. This were ſomewhat, if it were all true; but he proves none of it. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> in his <hi>Eccleſ. Hiſtor. lib.</hi> 2. relates that the monſter <hi>Nero</hi> was, as a Woman, married to one <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and that <hi>Xiphiline</hi> ſays the ſame and alſo, that as a Male he was as mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly married to one <hi>Sporus! Oroſius</hi> ſays the ſame; only whereas ſome call the former infamous perſon, <hi>Pythagoras, Sueton</hi> calls him <hi>Doryphorus, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro's</hi> freed-man: yet in this as there is no mention of Nobility, ſo neither of compulſion. Wherefore unleſs we ſaw better ground for this aſſertion, we may rather ſeek ſome other reaſon; and I propoſe this. The Poet does not here compare the two faults for the Hainouſneſs, but for the impudence in the committing of them: in which reſpect, this though the leſs ſin in it ſelf, did exceed the former. For in the committing of that, they had ſome ſhame, as the Poet implied ſaying, — <hi>Nubit amicus, Nec multos adhibet</hi>—, it muſt be cloſely carried; and <hi>Fiert iſtapalam</hi>—, hereafter they will commit this openly, ſo that as yet it was a ſecret villanie: but as for This Baſeneſs, though extream, they run into it open faced; as may appear from the nature of the fault now to be ſet forth. Of the two that are here deſcribed for the combat, the one was called <hi>Retiarius,</hi> as this <hi>Gracchus</hi> here was; the other <hi>Myrmillo</hi> and <hi>Sequutor.</hi> The firſt is (in effect) uſed a little after this paſſage, when the Poet ſays,—<hi>retia miſit:</hi> the two latter are uſed in <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. where the Poet falls again more largly and vehemently upon this argument. Yet becauſe the Antiquity and Form of theſe exerciſes is very neceſſary to be here declar'd, the expoſition of that in the eighth <hi>Sat.</hi> may be here deliver'd. The <hi>Retiarius</hi> then was ſo call'd from the principal part of his furniture, which was diverſe. For firſt he was dreſſed in a ſhort Coat, which beſeem'd not the ſtate of a Noble Perſon. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly he had a three-pointed Mace or iron in his left hand; and thirdly a Net in his right; with which, if he could by his ſkill (which was commonly pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticed) he did enwrap his adverſary by ſodainly caſting of it over his head and as ſodainly drawing it together, and then with his trident uſually ſlew him. In which mad exerciſes, the net was counted ſuch an advantage, that they allowed the <hi>Retiarius</hi> no other fence. For on his head he woar only a hat or long cap tied under his chin with a broad ſtring or ribband, as this <hi>Gracchus</hi> is deſcribed, <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. And thus he fought in part bare-faced, which farther ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued the unworthineſs of ſuch a perſon, thus to engage his life and honour with a hireling. The other combatant was called <hi>Myrmillo,</hi> who, beſides a hooked ſword <hi>(falx ſupina)</hi> and a buckler, was allowed alſo a helmet, whereon was the picture of a fiſh: which gave occaſion to the <hi>Retiarius</hi> to ſay uſually to the <hi>Myrmillo</hi> that ſtrived to avoid the caſting of the net, <hi>Non te peto, piſcem peto, quid me fugis Galle?</hi> not that the <hi>Myrmillo</hi> was always a <hi>Gaul</hi> or <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> but becauſe his Armour or furniture was after the <hi>Gallique</hi> faſhion. The reaſon of the name <hi>Myrmillo</hi> is by ſome mentioned, as by <hi>Marcellus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus</hi> on Sueton's <hi>Caligula, cap.</hi> 32 where <hi>Myrmillones</hi> are ſaid to be ſo called, <hi>quaſi Myrmidones,</hi> as if it were from their ſingular valour, the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their time been the flower of the <hi>Greek</hi> ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery. But not to abuſe our ſelves with ſuch deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the learned <hi>Johannes Iſacius Pontanus</hi> in his <hi>Gloſſarium Priſco-Gallicum,</hi> in the word <hi>Myrmillo, p.</hi> 254. tells us, that the <hi>Myrmillo</hi> is a fiſh by the <hi>French-men</hi> anciently called <hi>Mormyron,</hi> or <hi>Mormilon,</hi> which will ſo ſubtilly ſhoot himſelf into the mud, that the Fiſhermen are ſcarce able to take him with a drag. And becauſe he that fought with the <hi>Retia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> did ſometimes uſe great bendings or windings of his body to avoid the net, and as it were to hide himſelf from the art of the <hi>Retiarius;</hi> therefore by ſimilitude he was called <hi>Myrmillo,</hi> and wore the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the fiſh upon his helmet. Thus <hi>Pontanus,</hi> chiefly out of <hi>Gillius,</hi> partly out of <hi>Geſner;</hi> though the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> indeed gave the light to them all: who on this word, <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 199. gives this note, <hi>Mirmillo armaturae Gallicae nomen, ex piſce inditum, cuius imago in galeâ fingitur.</hi> The <hi>Myrmillo</hi> is alſo upon occaſion, <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. v. 210. called <hi>Sequutor,</hi> as much as the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuer;</hi> becauſe if the <hi>Retiarius</hi> did not cunningly poiſe his arm in the caſting of his net, but caſt either to ſhort or to far, ſo that he miſſed his purpoſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly he betook himſelf to his heels, running a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Amphitheater</hi> for his life, with all poſſible agilitie, that he might happily recollect his net for a ſecond caſt; the <hi>myrmillo</hi> in the mean time as ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſuing him (whence he was called <hi>Sequutor</hi>) to deprive him, if he could, of his purpoſe and life. This kind of fighting (with the Net) came from <hi>Pittacus</hi> the wife <hi>Grecian,</hi> who (as <hi>Diogenes Laertius</hi> relates) fighting a ſingle combat with <hi>Phrynon,</hi> did with a net which he hid under his buckler ſodainly entangle him and then ſlew him.</p>

Which employments though tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, if perform'd ſeverally and by ſutable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, were an argument of baſe greedineſs, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed all by the ſame perſon. Yet ſuch there were and they grew rich, though formerly they had been but cornet-winders, and that but in pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Towns. Nor were they only grown rich, but alſo impudent; for, having in former time baſely hazarded their lives in Shews ſet forth by the Wealthy <hi>Romans</hi> to pleaſe the People, and ſo might have loſt their lives, if overcome, had but the People but pleaſed to turn their thumb; now they themſelves, though once ſuch vile perſons, ſet forth ſuch coſtly Shews, wherein others at their wanton charge were familiarly kill'd.

For which interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation he is reprehended by <hi>Politian,</hi> in his <hi>Miſcell. cap.</hi> 42. who by this ſeems to implie, that it was an expreſſion not of the hand, but only of the thumb; proving it from that of <hi>Pliny, Nat. Hiſtor. lib.</hi> 82. <hi>Pollices, cum favemus, premere, etiam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbio jubemur:</hi> but I ſee not how this authority refutes <hi>Porphyrio;</hi> who proceeding in his expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſays, though with ſome obſcurity, that <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laudat vehementiùs manus jungens jungit pollicem cum proximo. Acron</hi> would have <hi>premere pollices</hi> to be the liſting up of the hands and the moving of them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>Cruquius</hi> ſpeaking of this phraſe mentions on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>pollicem</hi> in the ſingular number, with no ſmall alteration of the matter; and adds, that this is done, when the thumb preſſing upon the top of the middle finger falls back towards the the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger making a noiſe; and that, if it were done on both hands, it was the greateſt approbation. So <hi>convertere pollicem,</hi> according to him, was to open the hand, and ſo conſequently not to make ſuch noiſe, or give ſuch notice. But <hi>Ferrarius, de Veter. Acclamation. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. juſtly objects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, that this were not <hi>pollicis preſſus,</hi> but <hi>crepitus digitorum,</hi> not a geſture of the thumb, but a noiſe of the fingers. He therefore rejecting all this expoſition as uncertain, if not falſe, thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides the point. Firſt, at the Sword-plays or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely Fencing it was uſual for him that overcame, to kill the other; yet the matter was altered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſign, which the people were pleas'd to make, ſo great was their power at theſe ſhews: and accordingly, ſometimes they made a ſign, to have the perſon, that was overcome, ſlain; and ſometimes they made a ſign to have him ſaved. Secondly, theſe ſigns were very eaſie to de diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, being of ſuch ſodain importance, and were inſtantly underſtood; the ſign of favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made with both hands, the ſign of death only
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62892:32"/>with one; the firſt of which was called <hi>premere pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices,</hi> the ſecond <hi>vertere pollicem.</hi> Thirdly, he thinks the manner to have been this; <hi>Premere pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices</hi> was to lift-up both hands and clinch them as a fiſt, <hi>pollices ipſos intra pugnum arctè vehementerque comprimere,</hi> that is, to clinch the thumbs ſtrongly and vehemently within the fiſt. Which expreſſion, in this laſt point ſeems ſomewhat unneceſſary: for, what did it avail to the makeing of the ſign <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt,</hi> to clinch their thumbs either <hi>vehemently</hi> or <hi>gently? Vertere pollicem,</hi> ſays he, was to lift-up one hand clinch'd like a fiſt, the thumb appearing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the fiſt, and either to point it backward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward himſelf that held it up, or to move it about circularly. But this might more strictly have been anciently render'd, ſuppoſing this to have been the ſenſe, by <hi>elevare pollicem,</hi> or <hi>invertere pollicem:</hi> though this be likewiſe liable to his own cenſure, being but probable. Yet I think his expreſſion comes <hi>near</hi> the cuſtome: notwithſtanding with a like libertie I think I may reaſonably vary and enlarge the conjecture. The natural acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all people are generally much alike, and therefore the outward expreſſions of approbation and diſlike; and no more was intended by theſe ſigns. When therefore the people ſaw a brave fencer ſometimes unhappily put to the worſt, we may probably ſuppoſe, that they did inſtantly, to ſave his life, lift up both their fiſts, their thumbs being clinch'd or preſs'd on each fiſt, yet not both their hands put together, but each being at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as men that are ready to ſtrike, the left arm being ſtretch'd out and the right ſomewhat drawn back. So that the immediate or firſt ſignification of this ſign ſeems to have been a threatning of the conquerer, if he ſpar'd not the life of him, whom he overcame; a ſecond and but a conſequent ſenſe was an applauſe of his valour and ſkill: and this we ghueſs to have been the ſign, which they called <hi>premere pollices,</hi> to clinch the fiſts at one. But if they ſaw that he which was overcome, had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hav'd himſelf but like a coward, without courage or art, we may ſuppoſe they did clinch one hand, the thumb ſtanding upwards, and ſo caſt their hand moderately over their ſhoulder, in a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, as if one would have ſaid <hi>Away with him,</hi> meaning that he was not worth their mercy. And this they might call <hi>vertere pollicem,</hi> that is, <hi>reiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jicere,</hi> to caſt back the thumb, or to <hi>turn</hi> it over the ſhoulder. But I leave everyman here to the libertie of his own phanſie, contentingmy ſelf in theſe conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctural arguments to propoſe that, which to me ſeems moſt natural, and ſo moſt eaſie to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>

For firſt, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the conſtruction (as is ſhew'd) ought to be <hi>filius ingenuorum; alter</hi> cannot ſo naturally be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the neareſt in place, namely to <hi>ingenuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum filius</hi> immediately precedent, as to that which was more remote, namely <hi>divitis ſervus: alter</hi> being as it were a calling back of a thing formerly named. Secondly, ſeeing that by <hi>alter,</hi> the Poet, as the deſcription ſhews, expreſſes one more waſtful and Luxurious, and by <hi>tu</hi> one more thrifty and courſely wanton; it were not ſutable to his indignation to make the Freeman in a better or more plentiful fortune, then the ſervant: and therefore he muſt by <hi>Alter</hi> rather intend the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and by <hi>tu,</hi> the Freeman. But here though <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>bin</hi> tells us, that as far as he knows, never any man before him rightly underſtood this place; yet methinks he does not rightly expound it, whiles he underſtands both by <hi>Alter</hi> and <hi>Tu,</hi> only the Rich: when as the diverſity of their condition is a cheif part of the Poet's intent, and explains the reaſon of his ſpeech. The Poet in effect ſays, that ſuch is the baſeneſs now in <hi>Rome,</hi> that the Son of a Freeman gives the better hand to a rich man's ſervant, or (as the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> ſays) to one now grown in wealth, who notwithſtanding was but a ſervant, and as it were, ſmells ſtill of his ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Yet is it not fit? ſeeing that the one <hi>(al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi> the ſervant is grown ſo rich, that he can give as much to his gallant harlot, as the <hi>Tribune</hi> has for his military Pay; but that the other, the Freeman, as Poor, is afraid to deal with ſuch a coſtly peice of pleaſure. Thus the ſway of the ſpeech and reaſon ſeems to be, that it is but ſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they differ in their precedency, as they differ in the curioſity and courſeneſs of their luſt. This point then being excepted, I grant the reſt of <hi>Lubin</hi>'s interpretation to be good; as that the Poet here inveighs againſt the baſeneſs both of the Freeman and the ſervant grown rich, that they both ran obſequiouſly for the doal or <hi>Sportula,</hi> and then as vilely ſpent it. Likewiſe, that in their running, the Poet notes the baſeneſs of the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who not only made himſelf the companion of a ſervant, or of one lately a ſervant, but alſo went on the lower hand. For to that ſenſe <hi>claudere la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> is uſually extended, it ſignifying to guard ones ſide, as an attendant does, that protects a man, and ſo conſequently one that goes on the inferior ſide.

For when he ſays in the ſixt Satyre, — <hi>atque opicae caſtigat amicae Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi>—, he intends, according to the receiv'd expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that place, that a proud <hi>Roman</hi> dame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends her ſhe-friend (though but leſs ſkilful) as one Rude of Speech, particularly there of the <hi>Roman</hi> Speech. Whence it may be inferr'd, ſeing that in <hi>Agellius</hi> one ignorant of the <hi>Greek</hi> and in <hi>Juvenal</hi> one ignorant of the <hi>Latin</hi> is reprehended by the ſame word <hi>Opicus,</hi> that the word generally implies one <hi>Rude in Speech.</hi> And in this ſenſe it is expounded by <hi>Britannicus,</hi> who renders <hi>Opici</hi> by <hi>Rudes &amp; Barbari;</hi> nor had he erred, had he not ſtraitned the ſenſe to an Imperfection or Rudeneſs in One only language. The Poet then ſays <hi>Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> that the Poems, which were gnaw'd were Divine, that is here, moſt <hi>Eloquent,</hi> and the mice that gnaw'd them were moſt <hi>Barbarous.</hi>

The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which flatteries, notwithſtanding the loſs of their houſes and moveables, we may ghueſs to have been the greatneſs of their eſtate in land and their want of children.

Satyre, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the 57th. verſe of it. <hi>Seneca</hi> likewiſe <hi>de Beneficiis, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 30. mentions <hi>Fabius Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus;</hi> on which place <hi>Lipſius</hi> alleges that of <hi>Juvenal, Sat.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 14. <hi>Natus in Herculeo Fabius lare:</hi> which <hi>Fabius</hi> he makes to be him, of whom <hi>Seneca</hi> ſpeaks. Yet I think that this acception of the word ought not to take place here, but that it only expreſſes <hi>Arturius</hi> by his Country, and ſo ſhews with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity the ſucceſs of his deviſe. I approve there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt opinion, which is the opinion alſo of the <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> who expreſſing his reaſon ſays this, <hi>Perſicum, quaſi divites poſuit: eo quod Perſae divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi> I will only add, that if I would venter upon conjecture, I might ſay it is a name purpoſely here uſed by <hi>Juvenal</hi> to ſignifie a witty fellow, that was able to put ſuch a trick upon the covetous and cunning <hi>Romans,</hi> as by firing his own houſe, to get more then he loſt. For <hi>Varro de Linguâ Lat. lib.</hi> 16. p. 82. ſays, <hi>Perficus a perito. Itaque ſub hoc gloſſema Callidè ſubſcribunt.</hi> Upon which paſſage of <hi>Varro,</hi> the accurate <hi>Antonius Auguſtinus</hi> in his <hi>Emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations,</hi> p. 46. (according to <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s Edition) places this note, <hi>Perſicus fortaſſe ſcribendum ex Sext. Pompeio, qui per acatum interpretatur; &amp; baec Naevii verba refert, Et qui fucrit Perficus, carpenti adeſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio.</hi> So that <hi>Perſicus</hi> may thus ſignifie as much as <hi>peritus, callidus</hi> and acutus, a cunning fellow; nor may the word, though ſeeming obſolete, be any hindrance, ſeeing that <hi>Juvenal</hi> but a little before, did for his purpoſe uſe the word <hi>Opicus,</hi> which ſtrictly was not of much uſe: yet I propoſe this only in a libertie of conjecture.</p>

It is ſufficient in this place to render it only in general, Fiſh; though, <hi>Sat.</hi> 14. where it is reckon'd with others as a ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſort, I render it, for defect of a proper name for it with us, a Nimble-tail, according to the Ety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mologie from the exceſſive motion of that part. The Poet calls them here <hi>municipes Siluros,</hi> or his own Country Fiſh, by way of jeer, implying that they were alike baſe: but the other words; <hi>fractae de merce</hi> are variouſly interpreted, ſome expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by <hi>fracto vaſe,</hi> as if the Veſſels or Panniers in which they were carried, were broken (but this ſeems a week Expoſition); others laying the ſenſe on <hi>fracta,</hi> and ſuppoſing that it was ſold by ſmall

The Sick fear'd Quartans. <hi>Jam quartanam ſperantibus agris.</hi> The Poet by way of jeer expreſſes the Time, wherein Fear, not Heat, haſten'd the Fiſherman, namely the end of <hi>Autumne,</hi> or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Winter, towards the mid'ſt of <hi>December:</hi> which he deſcribes, by ſaying it was the time, wherein the ſick fear'd Quattans. For ſo <hi>Speran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus</hi> is here (as <hi>Sperare</hi> is by <hi>Virgil</hi> alſo taken for <hi>timere</hi>) commonly, and, as I think, rightly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted; by reaſon of the crazineſs uſual at that time of the year, not only proceeding from old and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſes, but alſo from the various temper of the aire. For though it ſomewhat agrees with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Spring for heat and cold, yet is there this eſpecial difference; that in the Spring the heat and cold are broken into one temper, but in <hi>Autuma</hi> they are both preſerv'd diſtinct, and too ſodainly ſucceſſive, it being cold in the morning, hot at noon, and cold again at evening. And as in the <hi>Autumne</hi> Melancholy is predominant, ſo alſo Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan agues, of which Melancholy is the cauſe. Yet <hi>Prolemaus Flavius</hi> in his <hi>Conjectan. cap.</hi> 17. takes <hi>ſperantibus</hi> in this place <hi>properly,</hi> ſaying that the ſick now <hi>hope</hi> for Quartans, which kill no man, as He ſeeks to prove, and into which at this ſeaſon other Feavers turn. Which opinion ſome other like; and <hi>Bernardus Reatinus, Annotat.</hi> 6. ſays, that after a Quartan, health increaſes, the length of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe having ſpent the Phlegmatick and Melancholy humours. Yet this opinion (though including ſome truth) prevails not, the Quartan being not commonly thought to be ſo courteous. Beſides it would hence follow, that the Quartan, whoſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is Melancholy, and ſo moſt proper to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the year, the <hi>Autumne,</hi> ſhould be placed in the Winter-quarter, the matter of whoſe diſeaſes are properly the Phlegmatick humour. So that to ſay, the Sick now hope for a Quartan were impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the time of that diſeaſe being <hi>properly</hi> paſt in the beginning of Winter: but to ſay they now <hi>fear</hi> it, ſtands with the ſeaſon of the diſeaſe; which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving tormented men the moſt of the <hi>Autumne,</hi> may well be fear'd at the approach of Winter. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it is but an uncomfortable way of cure to hope to be deliver'd from one ſhrew'd diſeaſe, by falling into another ſhrew'd diſeaſe. But the Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62892:43"/>having left this doubt, concerning the danger of Quartans, undecided; it will not be unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to clear it by the judgment of Phyſitias: who deſcribe two ſorts of Quartans; one ariſing from the Melancholie humor properly ſo called, and this they make not of any great danger; the other from <hi>atra bilis,</hi> which is likewiſe generally and fudely call'd Melancholie, but properly it is <hi>flave bilis vehementer aduſta,</hi> as amongſt others the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <hi>Maſſarias</hi> and <hi>Sennertus</hi> teach; and this they hold to be very dangerous, and unto both ateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute properly the ſame ſeaſon, the <hi>Autumn;</hi> not that they are not in other ſeaſons, but then: moſt, and moſt properly. This laſt kind then is to be here underſtood; ſo that <hi>flava bilis</hi> being corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Summer and grown vehemently aduſt or turn'd into <hi>atra bilis</hi> by the <hi>Autumn,</hi> vexing the ſick with a Quartan all the <hi>Autumn,</hi> may juſtly make the ſick afraid when Winter comes on, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been already ſo much oaſt down. We may a little farther take notice, that ſome of late would have it, <hi>jam quartanam ſpirantibus agris;</hi> that now the fields breath'd infectious Air, the cauſe of this diſeaſe. But this, for ought I find, is but in part confirm'd, only one copie having <hi>ſpirantibus agris:</hi> beſides, it daſhes againſt the former reaſon; ſince, by this interpretation the Quartan ſhould be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe appropriated (by the diſpoſition of the Air) to the beginning of winter, at which ſeaſon the end of it, rather then the beginning, is expected.</p>

Which being ſo clear a truth, there is one doubt fit to be obſerv'd, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe not obſerv'd by the Interpreters that expound this paſſage <hi>De ingenuo &amp; libero;</hi> and that is, how the Poet could ſay of <hi>Trebius, Tanquam habeas tria nomina;</hi> for this were plainly to denie him to be a Freeman. But <hi>Trebius,</hi> though poor, was one of <hi>Virro</hi>'s Clients, now Clients though they perform'd much honourarious attendance upon their patrons, yet were not properly ſervants, but ſometimes gueſts, and ſo Freemen. Let <hi>Juvenal</hi> be judge, who deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing Clients haſting for the <hi>ſportula,</hi> ſays it was <hi>Turbae rapiend a togetae;</hi> now the <hi>toga</hi> was proper to the Citizen, as the <hi>tunica</hi> without the <hi>toga,</hi> to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. <hi>Trebius</hi> then being a Freeman, we muſt (unleſs we will reject Copie) expound it with <hi>Britannicus, De Nobili,</hi> and underſtand <hi>Juvenal</hi> (as alſo <hi>Auſonius</hi>) to ſpeak of the right of three names as it was beſtowed for ſome ſamous cauſe at the firſt. So that <hi>Juvenal</hi> may ſeem here ſatyrically (though he himſelf alſo enjoy'd the priviledge of three names) to check the vain cuſtome of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing three names upon every one that was made free; ſuch emptie names being but the guiſt of their maſters, and as well marks of their old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, as of their new liberties. But if any would underſtand this paſſage <hi>De ingenuo</hi> according to the latter cuſtome of the <hi>Romans,</hi> they muſt flie to Conjecture for ſome new Reading. In which way of expoſition the learned <hi>Rigaltius</hi> very wittily thinks that <hi>Juvenal</hi> writ, <hi>Quanquam habeas tria no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mina:</hi> this indeed avoids the alleg'd inconvenience concerning <hi>Trebius,</hi> and according to this the ſenſe will be this, Thou <hi>Trebius,</hi> muſt not talk <hi>Freely,</hi> though thou art a <hi>Freeman:</hi> for <hi>Though</hi> thou art a Freeman, thou art but a poor man. But the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical rule of interpretation prefers not Gueſs before Copie, where this does yield a tolerable ſenſe; wherefore I retain in my interpretation the firſt expoſition; to this ſenſe, Thou maiſt not (though free) talk like a Nobleman, like a three-nam'd man <hi>of the firſt inſtitution,</hi> before the priviledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ordinary.

                           </gap>. But afterwards they learn't to ſwear by all the Gods and by creatures too. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> tells us <hi>Corinth.</hi> 74. that afterwards they had ſuch a ſuperſtitious opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that they ought out of greater reverence not ſo much as mention the name of their Gods in their oaths, which he ſignifies in theſe words <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>Socrates</hi> is recorded by the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> upon <hi>Ariſtoph.</hi> In <hi>Avib.</hi> for the Author of this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and he pretended to have had it from <hi>Rhadamanthus,</hi> who expreſſely forbad them to ſwear by the Gods, but allowed them to ſwear by the creatures; and hence ſprang the cuſtome of ſwearing by the head as he did in <hi>Virg.</hi>

And this was one reaſon why they accounted the head holy and Sacred as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> tells us <hi>Deipnoſop. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. (where he gives more reaſons) and why they accounted <hi>Sneezing</hi> a Diety, and why they expreſſed a profane fellow by this proverb <hi>cerebra ſine fine comedet,</hi> ſee the learned <hi>Caſaub.</hi> upon the place. This was alſo the reaſon why <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoras</hi> commanded his diſciples to abſtaine from beans: for <hi>Lucian</hi> gives this reaſon in his Dialogues, and <hi>Eustathius</hi> likewiſe in theſe words

For beans have the ſignature of the braines and ſo occaſion'd that ſymbole. This kind of ſwearing we find particularly forbid by our Saviour <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 36. where <hi>Grotius</hi> gives more inſtances of this way of ſwearing out of <hi>Syneſius</hi> and others, and makes ſome difference betwixt ſwearing by our own head, and the head of others which is here chiefly intended by our Poet.</p>

The Interpreters differ in the expoſition of this paſſage; which therefore it will be fit breifly to clear. The Poet ſets-forth here the arts of one's wife's mother leudly for gain teaching her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to entertain adulterers; ſo that by <hi>Illa,</hi> which is three ſeveral times uſed by the Poet in this place, muſt be underſtood <hi>ſocrus,</hi> the Wife's mother, who is here ſaid, by art or bribe to maſter the keepers, which jealous huſbands uſed to ſet over their wives. In which deſcription, <hi>Lubin</hi> and ſome others would have thoſe words <hi>corpore ſano</hi> to be underſtood of the <hi>wife,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Advacat Archigenem oneroſaque pallia jactat</hi> to be underflood of the <hi>mother;</hi> who faigning her daughter to be ſick, would ſend for an <hi>Archigenes</hi> a Phyſitian (one famous in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time) and ſubtilly remove the bedding from her faint daughter; but under this pretence inſteed of a Phyfitian admit an adulterer. But I think the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi>'s interpretation (follow'd alſo by <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicus</hi>) to be bettor, who expounds it <hi>only</hi> of the wife's <hi>mother;</hi> and indeed the conſtruction of the words does neceſſarily carry it. So that the ſenſe cannot naturally be, <hi>corpore ſano</hi> the <hi>daughter</hi> being well the mother ſends for the Phyſitian; but the <hi>mother her ſelf</hi> being well pretends ſickneſs, that ſo under a colour of a neceſſary attendance on the mother ſuppoſed to be ill, the daughter might ſubtilly meet with an adulterer under the ſhape of a Phyſitian.

                     <p>The Poet Satyrically deſcribing his Learned Dame, ſays that ſhe has her proper opinion <hi>de Summo Bono,</hi> which is the End or Aim of vertuous Actions, Then adds he, <hi>Nam quae docta nimis cupit &amp; facunda vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deri, &amp;c.</hi> Which Reaſon of the former ſpeech ſeems not ſo fully cleared by the Interpreters. But I conceive the mind of the Poet in this place to be briefly this; It needs not ſeem ſtrange, that ſhe has alſo her ſeveral opinion of the <hi>Summum Bonum:</hi> for ſhe that ſo mainly pretends to Learning and Eloquence, ſhould not only, as a Leader of a Sect, have This Novelty; but ſhould do many things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, as Philoſophers do, namely, have her coat deſcend but to the mid-leg, Sacrifice to <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> and pay the farthing for the Bath-fee; implying, that theſe things ſhe did not, either through ſhame or pride, as may appear from the more particular view of the three things he mentions. For firſt, ſhe was aſham'd to wear her coat like the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, Orators and ſuch learned men; whoſe faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is deſcribed, as <hi>Britannicus</hi> rightly notes, in that of <hi>Quintilian, Tunicae prioribus oris infrae genna paulum, poſterioribus ad medios poplites uſque perveniant. Nam infra mulierum eſt, ſupra centurionum.</hi> Which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es us that the coat of the Orator, and ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed learning, as <hi>Britannicus</hi> implies, teached on the fore-edge a little below the knee; on the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der edge to the middle of the hamme; that Lower was the wear of Women, Higher of Centurions. In which paſſage I render <hi>Crus,</hi> the <hi>Leg</hi> (not the thigh), anatomie giving us the libertie; which gives that name to that whole part of the body, from the heel to the hip, as <hi>Bartholinus</hi> tells us. <hi>Anat. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. according to which acception <hi>Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> will agree in their expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. But from this faſhion, though of the Learned, this Dame was deterred by ſhame; as likewiſe from the ſecond, which was the ſacrificing to <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanus;</hi> it being unlawful for Women; and more affected by. Learned men, as the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> tells us. Which in part is prov'd by <hi>Joſeph Scaliger;</hi> who on <hi>Varro, de linguâ Latinâ,</hi> lib. 4. p. 48. cites that of <hi>Cato</hi> ſpeaking of the Rites of <hi>Sylvanus; Mulier ad cam rem divinam ne adſit, nive videat, quomodo fiat;</hi> and afterwards <hi>Scaliger</hi> cites this of our Poet. The latter part alſo may likewiſe appear by what <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannicus</hi> ſays from the Authoritie of <hi>Cato, de re Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticâ;</hi> to wit, the Poets and learned men (the patterns of this learned Dame) who for, ſtudy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten reſorted to the delight of groves, did uſe to ſacrifice there to <hi>Mars Sylvanus.</hi> Yet we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that <hi>Scaliter</hi> in the place alleged ſays, that the Rites to <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> were perform'd by ſome Country-man, whether he were Ingenuous, or a Servant. Which difference may probably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, conciled, by allowing the <hi>Ordinary</hi> performance of that ſacrifice to have been the buſineſs of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:62892:70"/>Huſbandman, and the Learned to have been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Voluntary and Superadded Sacrificers. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it may be here obſerv'd, that when it is ſaid of this dame by the Poet, that ſhe ſhould ſacrifice a hog to <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> the Noveltie was not in the kind of the ſacrifice, but of the perſon, a Woman. For though at firſt they offerd milk unto him, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards a hog; which was a ſacrifice alſo to <hi>Tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> (as <hi>Horace</hi> teſtifies in his Epiſtles,) and to many other Deities, as to <hi>Ceres,</hi> the <hi>Lares,</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> of <hi>Livie, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>part.</hi> 4. The third thing which our Poet ſays this Dame ſhould do, whereby to ſhew her ſelf like a Philoſopher, is the payment of the mean and uſual Bath-fee (ſtrictly not a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but q. c. as appears, <hi>Sat.</hi> 1. <hi>Illuſt.</hi> 36.) But here we may ask, though the Interpreters preſs not the buſineſs to this doubt, how the payment of the uſual Bath-fee could make her like a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, when as it was not proper to Them, but the Common-ſee; which is therefore by <hi>Seneca. Epiſt.</hi> 86. call'd <hi>res quadrantaria.</hi> In anſwer to this doubt (which I but juſtly raiſe) I might allege what I find in the Manuſcript Commentary, which on this paſſage has this note, <hi>Pro balneis nihil ſolve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant mulieres:</hi> which, if admitted, would partly clear the buſineſs; but that I find this aſſertion only in this Commentary; and cannot but allege thoſe words of <hi>Tullie, pro Coelio</hi> (cited here by <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio,</hi> though not to this purpoſe) <hi>Niſi forte mulier potens quadrantariâ illa permutatione familiaris facla fuit Balneatori;</hi> which ſeems to imply, that Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men alſo paid the Bath-fee. To expreſs then mine own opinion, I think, that the Ironie here uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this learned dame, which could not be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to her ſex, was in reſpect of her Wealth and Pride, which made her like the Philoſophers rather in their vanitie, then in their ſeeming hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie of converſation. Like them ſhe would ſeem to be in the invention of a new opinion, rather then in a homely life; that ſhe thought glorious, this contemptible. She ſeems to be ſuch a one for Plenty, as that other proud and diſſolute Dame mention'd before (<hi>Illuſt.</hi> 42. and 43.) that ſcornd the common and petty proviſions of the Baths; but to theſe alſo, ſhe ſhould deſcend, as with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple even Philoſophers likewiſe did.</p>

Plume-Alume burns the skin: Lemmon-juice</hi> diſloves the hardeſt <hi>ſtones.</hi> Oile of <hi>Tartar</hi> takes <hi>ſtains</hi> out of <hi>cloth,</hi> and <hi>ſchorches fleſh.

But to proceed with our Author, one doubt may here ariſe; that ſeeing theſe <hi>Poppaeana</hi> were uſed by an Empreſs, how may we conveniently ſuppoſe, that they were not excellent? In which point we may believe, at leaſt gueſs from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients mention'd, that they had not in them the mineral danger of new inventions; yet were effectual for the beautifying and ſmoothing of the face, though of a leſs pleaſant ſmell; which was no great inconvenience in <hi>Poppaea's</hi> uſe of them; ſhe cleanſing her face from the groſſneſs of them, before ſhe went unto the Emperour: but the leud Dames here intended by our Poet, let them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courteouſly ſtick on (as preparatives) at home, and waſh'd them off only when they went to their paramours. Where we may farther obſerve, that <hi>Poppea</hi> had 50. ſhe-Aſſes, for ſuch purpoſe, as <hi>Pliny</hi> relates (<hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.) and carried ſo many with her, when ſhe was baniſh'd; and the ſame <hi>Pliny</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 28.) reports that ſome kept 700. for the like uſe. Yet ſays the Poet, <hi>Tandem aperit vultum, &amp; tectoria prima repo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Again, whereas, he ſays, upon the word <hi>Tecloria, ubi prima operimenta &amp; incructationes panis &amp; lactis aſinini à fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie removet,</hi> after that ſhe has taken off the Plaiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſteeped bread and Aſſes milk; how can it agree with the Poet, who ſays, <hi>Tectoria prima repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, incipit agnoſci, atque illo lacte fovetur,</hi> &amp;c. That after ſhe had laid afide her daubings, and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain her own face appear'd, ſhe yet us'd Aſſes milk? Theſe things then ſeeming inconſiſtent, I think the place may with beſt convenience, be order'd thus. Firſt he ſays, that ſhe us'd bread ſteep'd in Aſſes milk, or elſe <hi>poppaean</hi> ointments, which ſhe ſuffer'd to ſtick rudely upon her face, till ſhe went abroad to her Adulterer; but that then waſh'd off all the

Then, ſayes he, <hi>Tandem aperit,</hi> &amp;c. After ſhe is return'd, and has been a little while at home, ſhe wears again her own face, layes aſide her pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, and appears aged. Yet, that ſhe may not be ſtark ugly, though ſhe uſes not her plaiſterings, ſhe uſes Aſſes milk; and this is the beſt face, which ſhe beſtows upon her Huſband, though rather for ſhame, then Love; but at her times of preparing for out-a-dores viſits, he is glad to be content again with her <hi>plaiſter'd</hi> face.</p>

For though, I grant, the Poet did before deſcribe a learned Dame, one ſtudious of ancient Books; yet now he is upon the deſcription of another, and as I conceive of another temper, namely one imployed in Cruelty and Luſt. And though ſhe were indeed waſtful and deſtructive, as the Poet ſays afterwards; yet we may obſerve in her ſome pretended and diſſembled houſe-wifery, not only in this particular of puniſhing her ſpinning Maid, but afterwards in viewing of embroydered works, and the accounts of the day, <hi>tranſacta diei,</hi> or as ſome have it, <hi>tranſverſa;</hi> implying that the accounts were ſo long, that they were written even thwart the Paper (as for want of room) or on the other ſide, which was upon extremity.

Whereupon, the young men, that were at the place of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, did by way of ſport perform it, by taking a ripe <hi>apple,</hi> underſetting it with four ſticks inſteed of feet, and adding a couple more inſteed of horns. Which fictitious ramme was then offer'd, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not an unacceptable ſacrifice, afterwards this Rite continued amongſt them. Yet <hi>Brodaeus</hi> (in the fore-cited place) though he touches upon another kind of expoſition (as I ſhew'd) thinks that this water was by Merchants brought in ſhips to <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo ſould to ſuperſtitious Women. Which laſt we may probably admit for a truth, though we have no proof alleged for it; but the firſt indeed is proved truth. Yet with leave of them all, I think it not the truth here intended; nay, that it cannot be here intended: firſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the expreſs teſtimonie of the Poet, who more eſpecially ſays, <hi>Ibit</hi> and <hi>aquas portabit;</hi> ſo that he plainly ſays, that ſhe her ſelf did thus. And though he adds, <hi>ſi juſſerit,</hi> If <hi>Iö</hi> bids, yet the form of the ſpeech implies, that ſhe did ſometimes did ſo. Secondly and more preſſingly, (as I think) becauſe of the abſurd conſequence, if this were not the ſenſe: for what great matter had it been wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be inveighed againſt by a <hi>Satyriſt,</hi> if their ſuperſtition had been ſo wiſe and Lazy, as either to offer a feigned ſacrifice, or a true one ſo eaſily provided? And how had this been ſutable to have been join'd with the other cruel follies before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, which their ſuperſtitious fear impoſed upon themſelves? Which neceſſarie conſiderations thoſe learned Criticks might have uſed. Wherefore to ſpeak clearly, I think, that, according to <hi>Brodaus</hi> (if his opinion be proved true) theſe worſhippers <hi>might</hi> ſometimes offer <hi>ſuch</hi> water: ſecondly, that according to <hi>Servius,</hi> ſometimes they <hi>did</hi> offer <hi>ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulata pro veris;</hi> and that <hi>ſometimes</hi> they did, as our Poet here with indignation wonders-at, <hi>fetch it themſelves</hi> from the confines of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> even from <hi>Meroë</hi> in <hi>Aethiopia, ſuch Aegypto</hi> (as the <hi>Geographers</hi> call it) an Iland in <hi>Nilus</hi> (now called <hi>Gueguere</hi>) and in which was a City of the ſame name <hi>(Meroë)</hi>; the moſt Northern part of which <hi>Iland</hi> being about 16. degrees of North-latitude, well might the Poet ſay, that the waters of it were hot.</p>

Yet becauſe he gives no reaſon of his choice, and that the other example has been generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, as the ſtory here intended, and that I alſo notwithſtanding prefer his inſtance, I think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſhew mine own reaſon, for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his and mine own choice. The Poet then ſpeaking of <hi>Pontia</hi> aggravates her crime beyond thoſe of <hi>Medea</hi> and <hi>Progne;</hi> theirs being facts of revengeful paſſions, but not of coveteouſneſs; for ſo the Poet expreſſes it, —<hi>Sed non propter nummos.</hi> According to which diverſitie of cauſe, if we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this inſtance, we ſhall find, that <hi>Pontia</hi> (the Daughter of <hi>Petronius</hi> and wife of <hi>Bolanus</hi>) men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by the <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> offended as he ſays, <hi>ut adultero nuberet,</hi> and ſo in a Luſtful paſſion: but the offence of this <hi>Pontia</hi> (the daughter of <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi>) in the Inſcription, is term'd <hi>Avaritiae opus;</hi> and therefore I judge this to be the Perſon here intended, and farther deſcrib'd by the Poet (as one offending rather in the ſobriety of coveteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then in the rage of Luſt) whiles afterwards he ſays of her, —<hi>quae computat &amp; Scelus ingens Sana facit;</hi> the judgment being to be made not from the ſimilitude of their facts, but from the diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of the motives. And here the ordinary rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may note, that after the words here ſpoken by <hi>Pontia,</hi> the Poet ſpeaks the next, <hi>Worſt viper! at one ſupper didſt kill Two? Pontia</hi> then again adding the next, —<hi>Yea Seav'n, if th' had been Seav'n, had ſeem'd Few.</hi>

                     <p>This paſſage, if conſider'd, has a little difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; ſome taking <hi>clivus</hi> for <hi>pars radicis montis:</hi> but that cannot agree with <hi>clivo pendente;</hi> ſeeing that it will appear to be, <hi>not</hi> the <hi>bottome,</hi> but rather the top of the Mountain. <hi>Lubin</hi> well expounds <hi>mons ſubſtrahitur,</hi> by <hi>inferior, cui ſaxa incumbebant; not</hi> the <hi>loweſt</hi> or bottome-part of the hill, (for that could not fall a way) yet a <hi>low</hi> part, a part toward the

To make all then a little clearer, <hi>Juga</hi> muſt here ſignifie the v rockie Mountain with a long ridge and a promon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory: <hi>Mons</hi> muſt expreſs a <hi>Lower</hi> part, not the loweſt, toward the outſide (whoſe falling-away cauſes the reſt of the ruin); <hi>Latus</hi> is the <hi>upper</hi>-part (yet not the uppermoſt) of the main-ſide; which reſted upon the lower, <hi>Mons: ſaxa abrupta</hi> are a part of the <hi>latus,</hi> ſome parcels of ſtones uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally breaking from the main lump that falls; and <hi>clivus</hi> muſt ſignifie the uppermoſt part of all, or the <hi>over-hanging peak,</hi> the under-parts being gone.

Nay, ſays he, one may every where find amongſt them, ſuch as were the <hi>Belides</hi> (the neices of <hi>Belus</hi>) the Daughters of <hi>Danaus;</hi> who being fifty in all, and all married to ſo many Sons of their Unkle <hi>Aegyſtus,</hi> did all except two (<hi>Hypermneſtra</hi> and <hi>Bebryce</hi>) murder their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, by their Fathers appointment, upon the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-night.

The <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> mentions ſuch another kind ſtory of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Eriphyle;</hi> both which may be here aim'd-at by the Poet, for he ſpeaks in the plural number, <hi>Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent multae tibi Belides atque Eriphylae.</hi> Then goes he on ſaying, that one may meet betimes with a <hi>Tyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daris,</hi> a <hi>Clitemneſtra</hi> (the daughter of <hi>Tyndarus</hi>) who by the help of her paramour <hi>Aegyſtus,</hi> ſlew her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band <hi>Atrides</hi> (<hi>Agamemnon,</hi> the Son of <hi>Atreus</hi>) at a feaſt, after his return from <hi>Troy:</hi> though, ſays he, they are now indeed grown more cunning, performing ſuch deeds with more art, by poiſon. Yet he adds, that they would fall to rude work and the very axe, that is, more groſſely and ſurely diſpatch them, if their huſbands ſhould againſt their poiſons uſe but the <hi>Antidote</hi> of <hi>Mithridates</hi> the <hi>Pontick</hi> King, who was thrice overthrown, namely by <hi>Sylla, Lucullus</hi> and <hi>Pompey.</hi> For he indeed had an admirable receipt againſt all poiſons; of which <hi>Pliny</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 23. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.) ſays, that when <hi>Pompey</hi> overthrew him, he found in his cabinet, the compoſition of this Antidote, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten with his own hand; the Ingredients whereof were Two dried nuts, as many figs, and twenty leaves of rue bruiſed all together with one grain of ſalt; which if taken faſting, was a protection from all poiſon.

                     <p n="1">1. ONly in <hi>Caeſar. In Caeſare tantum.</hi> It is a great doubt here amongſt the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, which of the <hi>Caeſars</hi> is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. The <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> takes it for <hi>Nero;</hi> but without proof or probability, as may appear from the confirmation of a better opinion. Some underſtand it of <hi>Nerva;</hi> ſome of <hi>Trajan;</hi> who, as <hi>Britannicus</hi> ſhews out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> and <hi>Autumnus</hi> out of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> was a favourer of Learning. But there being in this Satyre, mention of <hi>Statius</hi> Contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary with our Poet, as of a perſon then flouriſhing, and likewiſe of <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Pantomime</hi> potent at the
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62892:81"/>time, wherein our Poet writ this Satyre, and who was alſo put to death by <hi>Domitian,</hi> theſe praiſes cannot extend to <hi>Trajan's</hi> time. <hi>Lubin</hi> therefore underſtands it of <hi>Domitian;</hi> ſaying, that though he were a cruel Tyrant, yet in the beginning of his raign he had ſome ſhew of Vertue, particularly of bounty, alleadging <hi>Sueton</hi> for it, but chiefly that of <hi>Quintilian (in Prolog. lib.</hi> 4.) ſaying of <hi>Domitian, —quo nec praeſentius aliquid, nec ſtudiis magis propitium numen eſt.</hi> Yet <hi>Lubin</hi> obſerving <hi>Juvenal</hi> to inveigh here againſt the avarice of Great men neglecting the wretched eſtate of learned men in thoſe times, confeſſes him to be in this Satyre very inconſtant: and ſome have thought this written only to move <hi>Domitian</hi> to be ſuch a Patron, as he is here deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to be, rather then to Teſtify, that he was ſuch a one. Others ſuppoſe, that ſeeing he writ ſo fiercely againſt <hi>Domitian</hi> in the fourth Satyre, he writes here only Ironically: which reaſon I think not ſufficient, though there be ſome truth in it; it being evident to the obſerving Reader, that <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> Satyres were not written according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, in which they now are placed; this ſeventh Satyre (for inſtance) being written in the life time of <hi>Domitian,</hi> but the fourth after his death, which is mention'd in the end of that Satyre. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore amongſt theſe diverſities, I think theſe praiſes to be here aſcribed to <hi>Domitian,</hi> not for a general patronage ſhew'd towards learned men, as may plainly appear from the whole courſe of this Satyre (except in the beginning) in the miſery of learn'd men of diverſe profeſſions; yet for the ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour towards ſome eminent wits in his Raign, as <hi>Valerius Flaccus, Statius, Martial,</hi> and <hi>Quintilian,</hi> who egregiouſly magnified even <hi>Domitian.</hi> Here then may be obſerv'd <hi>Juvenals</hi> reaſons, both for the praiſe and diſpraiſe of the ſame perſon; likewiſe his Satyrical wit, implying the ſorry condition, which ſome of theſe might have fallen into, had they not been ſuſtain'd by ſpecial favour; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Poets ingenuity, that conceal'd not the Beft of a Bad man.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To rent at <hi>Gabii</hi> a ſmall Bath, or thought to take at <hi>Rome</hi> ſome Bake-houſe. <hi>Balneolum Gabiis, Romae conducere furnos Tentarent—. Caelius Secundus Curio</hi> on this place thinks that it was an ancient proverb againſt poor men, which quak'd with cold, that they muſt think of taking upon a rent a Bath or a Bake-houſe, alleadging that of <hi>Horace, Qui fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus collegit, furnos &amp; balnea laudat.</hi> Which witty conjecture, I grant, may be admitted by way of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion: but to ſpeak in the ſtrict fidelity of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, I think the Poet to ſpeak here rather hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorically: which is the more probable, becauſe he adds ſuch things, as were not ſutable with that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, as that ſome Poets became <hi>Criers:</hi> in which imployment, according to the ſeaſon of the year, whiles in open places they waited for Chapmen, they might quake through cold, as well by their Office, as by their Poverty. I retain therefore the ordinary expoſition of <hi>Britannicus</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. —But poor <hi>Clio</hi> crept for releif to a Rich door. <hi>Eſuriens migraret in atria Clio.</hi> Some expound this of ſome Poets, who, as they think, became Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to Great men; others more tolerably think, that they went as mean Clients to Rich mens doors for the <hi>Sportula,</hi> or <hi>Basket-doal.</hi> The learned <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebus</hi> thinks, becauſe there is immediately before, mention of <hi>praecones,</hi> that therefore by <hi>atria</hi> are here underſtood <hi>atria Licinia</hi> (and ſuch like) in which large and publick places, publick ſales of goods were uſually made. That there were ſuch places, I acknowledge for a truth, yet I think them not to be here intended by the Poet: who being to give a reaſon, why ſome Poets turn'd Criers, ſays, <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſuriens migraret in atria, Cli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> that is, as I think, <hi>turn Paraſites</hi> to Great men. Which expoſition I may ſtrengthen from theſe two reaſons, the one drawn from a like expreſſion in another place of this ſame Satyre, where he ſays, — <hi>tu Nobilium magna atria curas?</hi> when as thou art neglected by the great ones, wilt thou yet be ſo baſe, as to haunt their Porches, and continue their Paraſite? The other from the coherence of this place; where the Poet ſays, that ſome thought it not vile to become <hi>Criers,</hi> when as they ſaw others become <hi>Paraſites;</hi> this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition being ſimply baſe, but that, though mean, being yet honeſt. But if it were expounded accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Turnebus,</hi> that <hi>ſome</hi> turn'd Criers, when they ſaw <hi>others</hi> do ſo, that is, when they ſaw others <hi>go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the places of publick ſales,</hi> it were, methinks, a very weak expreſſion; whereas the other is very Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical, and ſutable to what immediately follows, <hi>Nam ſi, &amp;c.</hi> for well might they, ſays he, turn Criers, like <hi>Machaera,</hi> when they had not a farthing in purſe. Thus then <hi>Praecones fieri</hi> and <hi>migrare in atria,</hi> is not the ſame; the latter ſignifying, to <hi>turn Paraſite.</hi> Where by the way the Poets Satyrical wit may be obſerved, who in the recital of the wares ſet to publick ſale, claps in amongſt Cup-boards, Cheſts, and ſuch trumpery, the Poems of ſome ſilly Artiſts in his time, ſuch as were <hi>Bacchus</hi> (or as others read it, <hi>Paccius</hi>) and <hi>Fauſtus;</hi> whoſe fabulous compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he names and flouts at.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Machaera</hi>'s name and trade. Some think that <hi>Machaera</hi> here ſignifies a <hi>foot-man with a weapon by his ſide,</hi> (meaning that needy Poets might become ſuch) many ſuch uſually in travail attending their Lord. But, to call ſuch a one by the name <hi>Machaera,</hi> is harſh, they being commonly and rightly called <hi>Machaerophori;</hi> ſee <hi>Tully ad Q. Fratrem, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 8.

The Poet ſhews, that ſingular Poverty and ſingular Poëtry are commonly inconſiſtent; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Horace</hi> call'd upon <hi>Bacchus,</hi> (as 2 <hi>Curm. Od.</hi> 19.) he was full of him; and that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, had <hi>Virgil</hi> been extream poor, he could not have made his ſtately deſcriptions of Furies, ſuch as <hi>Electo</hi> with her Curles of <hi>Snakes</hi> about her ears, inſteed of <hi>hair,</hi> as the Poets uſually feign. Then he inſtances in <hi>Rubrenus Lappa,</hi> an excellent Poet at that time, who had he had a Patron to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged him, would have equall'd <hi>Sophocles,</hi> and ſome few ſuch like: but his wit was obſcur'd by his poverty, which made him pawn hisplatters, though ſmall ones, and his cloak to <hi>Atrens</hi> the Uſurer. And here I may note two paſſages of <hi>Autumnus;</hi> who upon thoſe words ſpoken of <hi>Virgil, Caderent omnes à crinibus hydri,</hi> underſtands figuratively by <hi>hydri,</hi> his <hi>Bucoliques, in quibus,</hi> ſays he, <hi>agit de hydris Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentibus, noxiis herbis, &amp; anlmalibus nocentibus frugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus:</hi> ſo that according to Him, the meaning ſhould be, that had <hi>Virgil</hi> been poor, he could never have written his <hi>Bucolicks;</hi> when as the Interpreters commonly underſtand it rather (and, I think, ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) of his <hi>Aeneads;</hi> in which <hi>lib.</hi> 7. he himſelf ſays, —<hi>tor Erynnis ſibilat hydris,</hi> which is apparently more ſutable to the meaning of <hi>Juvenal;</hi> that in extream poverty <hi>Virgil</hi> himſelf could never have written his <hi>lofty Aeneads.</hi> Again, <hi>Autumnus</hi> takes <hi>Atrens</hi> here not for a <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurer,</hi> as moſt Interpreters do, but for a poor <hi>Tragick Poet;</hi> who as he ſays, <hi>alveolos</hi> and <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam</hi> (for ſo he reads, not <hi>

Yet <hi>Britannicus</hi> thinking it neither ſenſe, nor <hi>Latin,</hi> to expound <hi>pignorare</hi> to <hi>take</hi> to pawn, takes <hi>Atreus</hi> here, not as <hi>Autumnus,</hi> for the name of a Tragick <hi>Poet,</hi> but of a <hi>Tragedy</hi> written by <hi>Lappa.</hi> Which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition pleaſes <hi>Pulmannus</hi> alſo on this place: and ſo the ſenſe, which they conceive, muſt be this, that <hi>Lappa</hi>'s Tragedy of <hi>Atreus</hi> made him pawn his ſmall goods: they mean, by neglecting his time, whiles he intended his Play. But methinks, this is but a weak expoſition: for, having imploy'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf always in ſuch ſtudies, he would probubly have
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62892:82"/>been buſied, if not thus, as unprofitably.

Laſtly the <hi>Latin</hi> acception of <hi>pignorari</hi> and <hi>pignorare</hi> to <hi>take,</hi> as well as to <hi>give</hi> a pledge, is ſufficiently known; as from that of <hi>Tully, Mars ipſe ex acie fortiſſimum quemque pignorari ſolet;</hi> where it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies clearly, to <hi>take</hi> to himſelf.</p>

Joſeph Scaliger</hi> (in his <hi>Auſonian Lections, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.) diſcourſing of this paſſage of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, thinks that here is an intended reference to the <hi>Agones Capitolini,</hi> which were games firſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by <hi>Domitian</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games, in which, amongſt other Artiſts, Poets alſo contended for the Victory; and that in ſuch trials, <hi>Statius,</hi> after the incredible expectation of the whole City, did recite his <hi>Thebais,</hi> but pleas'd not, whereby others obtain'd the garland againſt him. Of this, ſays <hi>Scaliger,</hi> he complains in his <hi>Sylvae,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Epicede</hi> on his Father: for which cauſe <hi>Scaliger</hi> reprehends the ordinary expoſition of this place, ſaying, that <hi>fregit ſubſellia</hi> is as much as <hi>recitans non ſtetit, ſed excidit, hoc eſt, non placuit;</hi> in brief, that he was overcome. Which Cenſure of <hi>Scaliger</hi> is recited by <hi>Roſinus, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 18. and by <hi>Salmuth</hi> on <hi>Panciroll. lib</hi> 1. <hi>Tit.</hi> 42. and <hi>Scaliger</hi> himſelf falling upon the ſame agrument again in his <hi>Emendation of Times</hi> (p. 483, 484.) ſhews from <hi>Statius</hi> himſelf, how that he greiv'd, that he could not add the <hi>Capitolian</hi> Oaken garland to the <hi>Alban</hi> Olive garland, but that he was overcome by anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Poets, who had formerly overcome. But the ancient and common expoſition of this place is, that <hi>Statius</hi> in the reciting of his <hi>Thebais</hi> did ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly pleaſe: and therefore ſome expound <hi>fregit ſubſellia,</hi> of the loud and wonderful applauſe, which was beſtow'd upon him. In this vaſt diſtance of Opinions, there is roome to ſtand between them: and therefore to interpoſe mine own opinion, I think thus; firſt, with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that <hi>Statius</hi> had the worſt in reciting his <hi>Thebais</hi> at the <hi>Capitolian Agones;</hi> as is unanſwerable clear from <hi>Scaligers</hi> alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations; Secondly and differently from <hi>Scaliger,</hi> that in <hi>this</hi> place our Poet intends not that overthrow of <hi>Statius</hi> in theſe famous games; but only his reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of ſome part of his <hi>Thebais,</hi> in ſome Great man's houſe (according to the faſhion mention'd in the 8th. <hi>Illuſtration</hi> of this Satyre); and that in ſuch recital (probably after his overthrow) he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd his credit, admirably pleas'd, and thereby was incourag'd to publiſh his Poëme. For, that he thus pleas'd, it is invincibly evident from the whole ſcope of this place: wherein our Poet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes, that though he ſo ſingularly pleas'd, yet if he had not ſold a new play of <hi>Agave</hi> to <hi>Paris</hi> the famous Actour, he might have been ſtarved; Thirdly, that <hi>fregit ſubſellia,</hi> as it cannot be here expounded, with <hi>Scaliger,</hi> of his Overthrow, ſo neither, with the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> and ſome others, be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Applauſe; though I acknowledge that cuſtome and the marvailous exceſs of it. But I think that it ought to be more plainly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his own laborious and <hi>exalted</hi> recital, or <hi>pronunciation;</hi> and therefore <hi>Britannicus</hi> expounds <hi>verſu</hi> by <hi>recitatione verſuum;</hi> according to his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of that in the firſt Satyre —<hi>aſſiduo ruptae le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctore columnae;</hi> where he likewiſe adds, <hi>aſſiduo lecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; recitatoris clamore;</hi> and <hi>columnae ruptae</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes by this <hi>fregis ſubſellia;</hi> but firſt by that of <hi>Virgils Et cantu querulae rumpunt arbuſta cicada:</hi> where <hi>rumpunt</hi> cannot be applied to any <hi>return'd applauſe,</hi> but to the inſenſive noiſe of the graſle-hoppers themſelves. And in a like, but a worſe ſenſe, the Poet in the beginning of the firſt Satyre calls <hi>Codrus</hi> for his tedious recitation, <hi>raucus. Lubin</hi> does not mention <hi>Scaliger</hi>'s opinion, perchance to conceal his diſlike: but underſtands <hi>fregit ſubſellia</hi> of the wondrous multitude of Auditors, which by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Statius</hi> his Reading, flocking thither break the ſeats. Yet he preſently adds, <hi>vel potius eſt by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolica locutio de ipſo Statio recitante,</hi> who with the vehemency of his recitation might be ſaid to break the ſeats. It may by the way be farther obſerved, that <hi>Juvenal</hi> in ſpeaking of the great concourſe to hear <hi>Statius,</hi> ſays, <hi>tantaque libidine vulgi;</hi> where he may ſeem to diſcover ſome frailty of emulation; <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bido</hi> implying an exceſs to what it is applied, and <hi>vulgus</hi> diminiſhing the glory of the Poet, by the mean qualitie of the Auditory. In which point, it being not neceſſary for me to undertake an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute defence of our Poet, I may conſiderably al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege; firſt that our Poet generally in his firſt Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre does in ſome degree jeer at all Heroical Poems, as at unprofitable fictions: Secondly, that <hi>Statius</hi> his work, by the ſwelling of proper names of Perſons and places, is ſomewhat unhappily darken'd; though it cannot be denied to be a Compoſition full of delight, and for height of wit Admirable.</p>

Others without ſuch affectation take the word <hi>ſemeſtre not</hi> for the ſpace of <hi>half</hi> a month, but of <hi>ſix</hi> months (for the word will bear either ſenſe) and ſo they conveniently think, that the Poet here ſpeaks of ſuch rings, as he does in the firſt Satyre, where he ſpeaks of their ſix-months rings, namely heavy winter-rings, and lighter ſummer-rings: ſo that the Poet means, that even <hi>Paris,</hi> though a a Player, did if he pleas'd, ſo inrich Poets, that like Knights and other wealthy ones, they could at pleaſure wear their variety of gold-rings.

But ſome underſtand by —<hi>acrior illo, Qui venit</hi>— the Deb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's Proctour, or elſe his <hi>Pragmaticus,</hi> he that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the cuſtome of theſe times, turned the books for him; and by <hi>Codice,</hi> the book of the Laws, or as others, the book of the Debter's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts and Expences; or, as ſome, the book or bundle of papers containing the whole proceedings of the cauſe; and ſo they expound <hi>ad dubium no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> that he came on the <hi>debter</hi>'s behalf to <hi>diſprove</hi> the debt, by ſhewing it to be Doubtful. Yet theſe expoſitions, if conſider'd, will not ſtand. For, (to refute it by parts) to underſtand it of the <hi>Debter</hi>'s Proctor ſtriving to denie and diſprove the debt, is not ſo congruous; ſince the Poet might then more clearly have expreſſed it, by ſaying <hi>In dubium nomen,</hi> rather then <hi>ad dubium;</hi> the firſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying rather to diſprove, the latter to prove the debt. Beſides, to take <hi>Codex</hi> as <hi>Philip Beroald</hi> does (in his <hi>Annotat. p.</hi> 208.) for the <hi>Debter</hi>'s book of reckonings is moſt improbable; for of what force ſhould that be, to avoid the Creditor?

But <hi>Britannicus</hi> on this place ſays, <hi>quaſi dicat Tranſmarinum, non Romanum aut Campanum, quod optimum erat;</hi> that it was Forraign wine, not brave wine, ſuch as the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Campanian.</hi> The laſt and negative part of which ſpeech is true; the firſt and affirmative being falſe, in which he ſays, it was forraign wine.

Again whiles he ſays, that it was <hi>Campanian</hi> and yet brought down by <hi>Tiber,</hi> he ſpeaks clean contrarie to the way of conveighance; <hi>Campania</hi> being the Country now call'd <hi>Terra di La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voro,</hi> lying from <hi>Rome</hi> towards the South Eaſt; the main body of the Country call'd the Territorie of <hi>Rome</hi> (now <hi>Campagna di Roma</hi> in the North-Weſt part whereof <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf is ſeated) lying between the City of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Campania:</hi> whereas the Poet ſays, that the wine was <hi>devectum,</hi> brought <hi>down</hi> he <hi>Tiber;</hi> and therefore from the North South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to <hi>Rome.</hi> To amend therefore ſuch errors, we may take notice of <hi>Brodaeus</hi> his expoſition of this paſſage: who in his <hi>Miſcellanies, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. calls the wine here underſtood, <hi>Vinum Vejentanum,</hi> and adds, <hi>Tiberis autem Vejentem agrum a Cruſtumino dividit; vile omnino ac tenue, non exoticum, aut tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marinum, utpote Chium, &amp;c.</hi> So that he underſtands here <hi>Vejentane</hi> wine. Which though I believe to be a truth, yet it is neceſſary to quit one difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, before we may admit it; and that is, to ſhew the Country of this wine, that ſo it might be <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vectum,</hi> ſuch as might be brought down the <hi>Tiber:</hi> which point, though it be intimated by <hi>Brodaeus,</hi> yet it may ſeem contrary to the learned <hi>Ortelius,</hi> who in his <hi>Theſaurus Geograph.</hi> places <hi>Vejentum</hi> in <hi>Campania,</hi> as he notes out of <hi>Acron</hi> upon <hi>Horace,</hi> 2. <hi>Serm.</hi> which peradventure was the reaſon of <hi>Lubin</hi>'s aſſertion and miſtake, that this wine was <hi>de Agro Campano:</hi> but according to <hi>Brodaeus</hi> his intimation, it grew North-ward from <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo ſutably to the Poets deſcription.

He alludes to the Statues of <hi>Mercury,</hi> which were commonly at <hi>Athens</hi> placed by way of Religion over the Gates of their houſes, to one of which the Poet here compares this boaſter; telling him, that he will allow him to be a <hi>Cecropian,</hi> that is, an <hi>Athenian,</hi> yet not ſprung from <hi>Cecrops,</hi> the <hi>Athenian</hi> King. Now the Statue of <hi>Mercury</hi> at <hi>Athens,</hi> was a Marble Head ſet upon a ſhape-leſs Poſt; whereupon the Poet ſays, Thou art like a <hi>Mercury</hi>'s Head, only His is of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and thine Lives; or rather, ſays he, thou art like the Poſt, on which it ſtands; for that is not only without life, but alſo without lively form. Next he preſſes him with a witty reaſon, and jeer drawn from very Beaſts; ſaying, that there is no more reaſon why unprofitable men ſhould be eſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m'd, then why unprofitable Cattle: but, ſays he, the breed even of <hi>Hirpinus</hi> and <hi>Corytha,</hi> (the moſt famous <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Mare</hi> for breed, as being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly excellent at the Race) if it prove bad, (if their Colts prove but jades) is uſually turn'd-off to the Cart or Mill.

The <hi>M S.

But this acception of <hi>naulum</hi> being without warrant, this expoſition, as too weak, is not to be admitted. According to others then, the ſenſe of this place, if we collect it, will ſtand thus; The Poet having ſaid, that it is no true life to abound in wanton diet, and coſtly oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſtructs one, if happily he ſhould get the government of ſome Province, to deal juſtly with the poor Subjects; and not by oppreſſion to <hi>undoe</hi> ſubdued Princes (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates of <hi>M. Antonie</hi>) that is, as our Poet ſpeaks, to <hi>leave no marrow</hi> in their bones. Unto this courſe he moves him by two reaſons, the firſt is drawn from the Law and the injunction of the <hi>Curia,</hi> the <hi>Senate,</hi> which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire this of him at his departure to his charge: the ſecond is from the puniſhment of ſuch as in this kind have offended; ſuch as were <hi>Capito</hi> and <hi>Tutor</hi> [mention'd by <hi>Tacitus</hi>] who inſtead of ruling, robbed the <hi>Cilicians</hi> [though theſe whom they rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed were very pirates) but by the ſentence of the Senate, as by a thunder, were juſtly ſtruck. Yet the Poet bewailes it as a ſoul fault in the Senate, that, though they puniſh the former Governour, ſuffer the Succeſlour to be as bad: in which caſe ſays the Poet to any ſuch poor Provincial, Thy way is, O injur'd <hi>Chaerippus,</hi> even to ſeek out a Cryer to ſet thy cloaths to ſale, and other ſuch ſmall goods, which perchance are yet left, before the ſucceſſor does come with a new hunger, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the little that is left unto the: intending that if thus he turn'd his ſmall goods into mony, he might happily the better conceal the remainder. For, ſays he, never complain, never hire thy paſſage by Ship from the Province of <hi>Cilicia</hi> (for of that he ſpeaks) unto <hi>Rome,</hi> leaſt thou ſpend, the little thou haſt, in vain upon thy waſtage, and ſo be as deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of mony, as of remedy. This, as the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, I think the beſt interpretation deriv'd from the <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> and inlarg'd by <hi>Lubin.</hi> The Poet adds by way of a jeer againſt ſuch Oppreſſors, that if honeſly cannot keep them from Oppreſſion, yet now neceſſity muſt, there being little or nothing left in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Aſiatick</hi> Cities, ſpecially if compar'd with the ſpoils they yielded, when firſt conquer'd.</p>

Secondly by <hi>inſcripta lintea,</hi> I think according to the laſt Opinion, that they may moſt fitly here ſignifie the Inſcriptions over the Cells of Harlots, yet not as They think, in the Stews, but in <hi>Popinis:</hi> where though they were not by a publick allowance, yet by ſecret and corrupt practice they were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; and this expoſition I the rather make, as being more agreeable to a Satyrical ſharpneſs and aggravation. For, to make it a fault to go to the <hi>Thermae,</hi> is improper, it being the Pulick, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Cuſtome: Secondly, to make it a fault in him to go to the <hi>inſcripta lintea,</hi> if we take it for the Bath-linnen, is as abſur'd, this alſo being conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently lawful: or if we take it for linnen (as towels) uſed <hi>in popinis,</hi> it is but a faint expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſo likewiſe to take it for the hangings of a Tavern-room; or for the inſcriptions of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, the victuals, to be ſold there.

The Parricide was afterwards ſow'd-up in a ſack or bag; and in after-times there was ſow'd-in with him, an Ape, a Cock, a Serpent (or, as ſome more particularly, a <hi>viper</hi>) and a dog. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he was thrown into the Sea, or, in in-land pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, into the next lake or river. But <hi>Doſitheus</hi> the old <hi>Grammarian</hi> adds more eſpecially, that the <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leus</hi> being ſow'd-up was put into a cart, and drawn to the Sea, or Lake, or River, by a yoak of <hi>black</hi> Oxen. <hi>Hieronymus Magius</hi> in his <hi>Miſcellan. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. probably conjectures, that at the firſt there was nothing ſow'd up with the parricide, but that

Yet he thinks that <hi>Conftantine</hi> reviving the Law fallen to diſuſe might peradventure increaſe it. Indeed <hi>Quintilian</hi> in his <hi>Declàmations,</hi> did long before ſpeak ſo, <hi>Culeo &amp; ſerpentibus expianda feritas:</hi> yet we muſt add, that <hi>Juvenal</hi> and <hi>Quintilian</hi> lived at the ſame time; and that it were ridiculous to think that either of them could write ignorantly or would write falſly of his own time. Wherefore ſeeing that <hi>Juvenal</hi> implies the <hi>many</hi> crimes of <hi>Nero,</hi> even of <hi>this</hi> kind, by the many deſerved pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments for ſuch crimes; It appears that in <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi>'s time there was but one ſerpent ſow'd-up with the parricide; for otherwiſe he muſt have ſaid, that he deſerv'd <hi>more</hi> then <hi>two</hi> ſerpents, (even four) or elſe he had not expreſs'd what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, which alſo would have ſpoil'd the unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of his ſpeech, If he had ſaid, More then One Ape, Two ſerpents, and one ſack, if <hi>Magius</hi> his Conjecture took place. Wherefore I believe that <hi>Quintilian</hi> uſed the plural number for the ſingular. But whether <hi>Conſtantine</hi> alſo did ſo in the Reviving of the Law, it concerns not this doubt, being in after-times, and ſo no way contrary to what <hi>Juve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> implies of his own times.

Lection.</hi> on this place alleadges a Copie wherein it is, <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cida,</hi> as in another, <hi>Bruſtia praeſtabat calidi tibi faſcia viſci;</hi> where he thinks it ſhould be written either <hi>Bruccia,</hi> or <hi>Bruſcia:</hi> of the firſt of which he gives no expoſition; but the latter he thinks may come from <hi>Bruſcus</hi> (call'd by ſome <hi>ruſcus</hi> from the ruddly, colour of it) a prickled ſhrub, a kind of <hi>Broome</hi> (mention'd by <hi>Pliny. lib.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. becauſe, as he gueſſes, the <hi>faſcia</hi> might be <hi>ex bruſco;</hi> but this he does not affirm. Some read <hi>Bruttia,</hi> the <hi>Bruttian</hi> pitch, being anciently uſed for the fetching-off the hair; and ſo indeed (with a ſmall varietie in the Reading) <hi>Brucia</hi> ſignifies in <hi>Columella</hi> a kind of pitch, and ſo probably was, if not alone, yet, an ingredient of the <hi>pſilothrum;</hi> and ſo the word may be uſed here, according to ſuch Copies, either Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectively, or by way of Appoſition with <hi>faſcia.</hi> Yet this being without the farther warrant of Copies, I accept the common Reading and expoſition.

From which words, <hi>Naevolus</hi> having in the former expreſs'd the baſeneſs of <hi>Virro</hi> even towards the ſervants of his Luſt, ariſes a double doubt: one concerning the <hi>Perſons by whom,</hi> and <hi>to whom</hi> they are ſpoken; the other concerning the <hi>Time</hi> here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For the firſt, <hi>Lubin</hi> expounds theſe words as ſpoken by <hi>Naevolus</hi> unto himſelf, but againſt <hi>Virro</hi> in deriſion; as if by way of expoſtulation with himſelf he ſhould ſay, O <hi>Naevolus,</hi> is not this nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly wretch a trim creature, whom thou may'ſt complement with guifts at the uſual time of the <hi>Womens Calends? En tibi formoſulum illum—Virronem cui tanquam amicae mittas munera—feſtis Matronalibus!</hi> and thus by <hi>Tu</hi> underſtands <hi>Naevolus</hi> ſpeaking to <hi>himſelf.</hi> But by this interpretation of this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult paſſage (which ſome paſs-by) there were no congruity in the word <hi>tractas,</hi> which follows: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they cannot be applied to <hi>Naevolus</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſending the preſents, but to <hi>Virro,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generately receives them, as is here ſaid, after the ſolemn manner and Ceremonie of Women.

                        <pb n="177" facs="tcp:62892:99"/>and inſtead of <hi>tractas</hi> thinks that it ſhould be <hi>tractas,</hi> expounding it thus, <hi>Et ipſe poſitus in cathedra tractas munera.</hi> But to attribute theſe words to the <hi>Poet,</hi> is without neceſſity or congruity; both the <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> and <hi>ſubſequent</hi> words, and <hi>theſe</hi> as conveniently, being the <hi>continued ſpeech of Naevolus to Virro:</hi> as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to read <hi>tractas</hi> is both unneceſſary and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous with the precedent <hi>Tu. Naevolus</hi> then ſpeaks this, with indignation to <hi>Virro,</hi> as if he would make even <hi>Him</hi> judge of his words, and uſing the word <hi>Tu</hi> by way of compariſon, ſhould ſay, Loe, art not Thou (meaning, were not ſuch a one as Thou, that art nigardly towards the inſtruments of thy plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and by whom a man gains nothing) a trimme creature, to whom thou might'ſt ſend guiſts for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, ſuch as at the ſhe-Calends they ſend to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, (and ſuch as thou thy ſelf alſo doſt unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily receive at the ſame times) a veil or bon-grace againſt the Sun, (which veil or ſhadow the Poet ſays was green, to expreſs the perſon that wore it, to be affected to the Green faction or party of the Charioters; as <hi>Lipſius</hi> thinks. <hi>De Amphitheatro c.</hi> 18.) or ſend <hi>grandia ſuccina</hi> (<hi>gemmata dextrocheria,</hi> brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, ſays the <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> or as others) large bowls of Amber? Thus then briefly it is <hi>Naevolus</hi> that ſpeaks, and in the continuance of the Speech does in the words <hi>Vos, Tu,</hi> and <hi>tractas</hi> intend <hi>Virro.</hi> For the ſecond doubt, which concerns the <hi>Time,</hi> when theſe guiſts were uſually ſent, it is deſcrib'd in thoſe words —<hi>natalis quoties redit, aut madidum ver Incipit</hi>— and <hi>Foemineis Calendis:</hi> all which, as ſome think ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs but the ſame time; underſtanding by <hi>Natalis, natalis Veneris;</hi> which was, ſay they, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring, on the <hi>Calends</hi> or Firſt of <hi>March.</hi> Indeed <hi>Famineae Calendae</hi> were the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> as the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> rightly notes; <hi>Calendis Martii quibus Junonis Sacra celebrantur a Romanis: quia &amp; tum Ilia compreſſa eſt à Marie. Tum nam Matronalia ſunt.</hi> But the ſame <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> on the words <hi>Madidum ver incipit,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Matronalibus ſcilicet, quae ſunt Calendis Aprili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>but, quibus eſt natalis Veneris;</hi> which though they thwart the former, and ſo ſhew this laſt clauſe to be but a corrupt addition to the true copy of the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> (though <hi>Autumnus</hi> alleadges this without taking notice of the error) yet they clearly make theſe two reaſons different, and come one point nearer to the <hi>Roman Kalendar,</hi> in which indeed is a <hi>Feaſt</hi> appointed to be celebrated to <hi>Venus</hi> on the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> Beſides, the Poet does not here ſay, <hi>natalis quoties redit &amp; madidum ver incipit,</hi> but <hi>aut madidum ver,</hi> by way of diſtinction, as making them two ſeveral ſeaſons. Not then the Birth-day of <hi>Venus</hi> ſeems here intended by <hi>natalis;</hi> but the Birth-day of the woman [here, Satyrically, of <hi>Virro</hi>] to whom guifts were then by cuſtome ſent: and ſo it is rightly underſtood by <hi>Britannicus,</hi> and after him by <hi>Lubin;</hi> but that <hi>Lubin</hi> does alſo place the birth-day of <hi>Venus</hi> on the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> though without alleadging any authority. Again, on the words —<hi>aut madidum ver, Lubin</hi> ſays, <hi>nam tempore veris, quod plerunque madidum eſt, Calenda Martiae ſunt,</hi> and this he ſays truly and warily enough, that the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>March</hi> are in the Spring: but on the next word <hi>Incipit,</hi> he ſays, <hi>Nam principium veris incipiebat Calendis Martiis.</hi> Where (to paſs by the caſual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety in ſaying, <hi>Principium incipiebat,</hi> the Poet ſpeaking exactly, <hi>ver incipit</hi>) he affirms the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Spring to be on the firſt of <hi>March;</hi> which though I grant <hi>Juvenal</hi> here ſays ſpeaking in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and latitude of a Poet, yet <hi>Lubin</hi> ſhould have ſpoken according to the <hi>Roman Calendar:</hi> in which this note, <hi>veris initium,</hi> is placed on the fift of the <hi>Ides</hi> (that is, the 9. day) of <hi>February.</hi> But with an equal licenſe to our Author we will grant, that the beginning of the Spring, and the firſt of <hi>March</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign here the ſame Time and the Seaſon of ſending guiſts to women, and to be call'd <hi>Faemineae Calendae.</hi> Yet the reaſon of the name was not as ſome have thought, becauſe the <hi>Calends</hi> of every month were ſacred to <hi>Juno;</hi> though this was true, as <hi>Ovid</hi> ſayes [<hi>Faſt. lib.</hi> 1.] <hi>vendicat Aaſonias Junonis cura Calendas;</hi> for which cauſe ſhe was called by the <hi>Laurentes, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendaris,</hi> as <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the <hi>Calends</hi> of <hi>March</hi> [which now we call St. <hi>Davids</hi> day] more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly were call'd <hi>Faemineae Calendae,</hi> being the day whereon anciently the <hi>Sabine</hi> Dames decided the Battle between their Parents and Husbands; and the time of their Feaſt called <hi>Matronalia;</hi> and the day whereon the more ſtately and dainty women did yearly ſit at home in great Solemnity, <hi>longâ Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedrâ</hi> (the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> renders it by <hi>ſcamnum;</hi> on a bench or form, or rather) in a high and large chair richly adorned, receiving guiſts of thoſe that honour'd them which being proper to women, <hi>Naevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> here imputes diſgracefully to <hi>Virro,</hi> as his ſecret and degenerate practice.

For, he has but one ſervant, as <hi>Polyphemus</hi> had but One eie, a broad one, <hi>by</hi> which ſubtle <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſses</hi> ſcap'd; and therefore adds, <hi>Alier emendus erit,</hi> &amp;c. he muſt needs provide himſelf another, and both of them muſt be fed and cloath'd. In which ſpeech, the comparing of his One ſervant to <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his One eie, ſeems to many but affected, if not very abſur'd and ſortiſh; and likewiſe to ſay, that he ſcap'd <hi>by</hi> his eie. <hi>Lubin</hi> therefore, who thinks thus of this paſſage, labours to ſalve it by theſe two ways; Firſt, by making the ſenſe to be this; That as one eie did not ſerve <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his turn, but that by the loſs of that only, having not another to help, he was quite blind; ſo he having but one ſervant, had need of another to ſupplie the poſſible loſs of him which he had, ſo to prevent the miſery, into which he might otherwiſe fall: Secondly by ſaying, that the Poet purpoſely here makes <hi>Naevolus</hi> ſpeak thus ſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly, that he might ſhew him to be not only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted deſperately in his <hi>Moralls,</hi> but as much pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd in his <hi>Intellectuals.</hi> The learned <hi>Rigaltius (de Satyra Juvenalis)</hi> ſays on this paſſage, <hi>dixit —adeo latam fuiſſe illius oculi aciem, ut per eam <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes evaſerit:</hi> whereby, it ſeems, he means that <hi>Nae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volus</hi> ſays, <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his eie was ſo broad, that <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> ſcap'd through it, as through a paſſage. For he makes the <hi>breadth</hi> of the eie the <hi>means</hi> of the <hi>eſcape:</hi> and then wittily thinks, that the Poet here flouts at <hi>Virgil</hi>'s wild <hi>hyperbole (Aeneid.</hi> 3.) in his deſcription of <hi>Polyphemus</hi> his eie; which he there ſays was <hi>Argolici clypei &amp;c Phaebaeae lampadis inſtar,</hi> large as an <hi>Argolick</hi> ſhield, nay, as the Sun.

                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> ſcaped <hi>per Cyclopis oculum?</hi> eſpecially when his eie was put-out, and that his <hi>blindneſs</hi> was the occaſion of the eſcape? yet to ſpeak in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous libertie, though it be granted, that <hi>unicus</hi> is to be allow'd that ſenſe, which he proves it to be uſed in; yet I likewiſe think that in this place it ought alſo to ſignifie in that ſenſe, in which the Interpreters here take it, both his <hi>belov'd</hi> ſervant and his <hi>one</hi> ſervant; but literally and chiefly <hi>this:</hi> as is manifeſt by the word <hi>alter</hi> which follows, and anſwers to it. <hi>Alter emendus erit,</hi> ſuppoſing <hi>unus</hi> (though in the word <hi>unicus</hi>) ſpoken of before. And for the other exceptions, I think them to be very acute and rigorous: for, to confine a Poet to a <hi>Logical,</hi> exactneſs of expreſſion, is to take away not only Poëtical Licence, but alſo Libertie. Nay, even Logick it ſelf, the ſevere Art of Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits aequivocal expreſſions, and ſo an eie, though put-out, to be term'd an eie. Beſides, may it not reliſh of a Satyrical jeere, to call that an eie, which but lately had its ſight, and was by a ſubtilty ſo ſoon depriv'd of it? But what if in a conjectural libertie, <hi>per</hi> be in this place taken as in that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Perſius, Per me ſint omnia protenus alba?</hi> that is, <hi>me permittente</hi> or <hi>non obſtante,</hi> and ſo <hi>per quam</hi> interpreted by <hi>quâ tamen lata acie non impediente</hi> (intimating the ſcoffe, that it was put-out) <hi>ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers evaſit <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes?</hi> The drift of the ſpeech, though not in expreſs terms, yet implied in the ſenſe, will be in the compariſon of <hi>lata</hi> and <hi>ſollers:</hi> the meaning being, that though his One, his <hi>only</hi> and dear eie were very great, yet <hi>

Wherefore this difficulty may be examin'd by a more abſolute way; <hi>not</hi> that of the <hi>Romans, but</hi> of <hi>Nature:</hi> which teaches us, that the Cocks naturally crow at three eſpecial ſeaſons in the night; as they are diſtinguiſh'd and pointed-out unto us, by our <hi>Engliſh Varro</hi> (for <hi>Rural</hi> knowledge) our Authenck <hi>Tuſſer</hi> in his Poetical <hi>Husbandry</hi> (p. 123. in his note of Cock-crowing where he thus delivers it,

By which natural way of trial, the firſt ſeaſon of the Cock-crowing being at Midnight, and the third an hour before day, the <hi>ſecond</hi> muſt be at <hi>Three in the Morning,</hi> the ſeaſon here intended, ſutable to <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s expreſſion, admitting a ſuppoſal of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient time between <hi>Virro</hi>'s fact and his ſervants diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.

But the moſt and the beſt Copies have <hi>figam;</hi> by reaſon of the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of which word, there are two expoſitions of this place The one according to the uſe of the word, according to which it ſignifies as much as <hi>conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> or <hi>componam,</hi> to <hi>get,</hi> or <hi>ſettle;</hi> and then the ſenſe would be, When ſhall I get ſome ſure ſtay, to ſhield me in my old age from uncomfortable beggery? The other is according to the uſe of the word, whereby it ſignifies to <hi>ſix,</hi> and ſo implies a relation to an anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cuſtome of fixing their vowes with <hi>wax</hi> to the <hi>knees</hi> of the Gods, which the Poet in the 10th. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre</hi> calls, <hi>genua incerare Deorum;</hi> and then the ſenſe will be, when ſhall I ſo faſten a vow to the knees of the Gods, that I may obtain in my old age Plenty and conveniency? And thus <hi>Rutgerſius (Var.

And to this expoſition, I confeſs, I incline, not that I think becauſe <hi>figam may</hi> ſo ſignifie, therefore it muſt: but (to expreſs mine own reaſon) becauſe all that which follows will better agree with <hi>figam</hi> taken in this ſenſe, then in the other. For <hi>Naevolus</hi> making here this <hi>figam aliquid quo ſit &amp;c.</hi> the cauſe of the many and great benefits which he deſires, ſhould then pray ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what incongruouſly: for if <hi>figam aliquid</hi> ſignified but ſome <hi>ſmall ſtay</hi> (as in that ſenſe it muſt) it could not though he obtain'd it, afford him <hi>thoſe parcels of plenty,</hi> which he mentions, as the <hi>conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi> of this deſire obtain'd. But if by <hi>figam ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid</hi> we underſtand a vow; we then muſt grant, that all the plenty which follows here, may ſafely and properly flow from it. For this reaſon (which I leave to the judgment of the Reader) I chooſe the latter expoſition, and accordingly render it,

Yet again he condemns this his deſire, confeſſing it to be but <hi>votum miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile,</hi> a vain deſire [or to be pittied) and therefore that it is but a folly to entertain the hope and expectation but of this much. For, ſays he, when I pray to <hi>Fortune,</hi> ſhe ſtops her ears with ſome of the wax, with which <hi>

Which natural gravitie, ſays he, is increas'd by frequent exerciſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently has the advantage of larger nouriſhment. This he proves alſo from the example of the <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons,</hi> who ſearing-off their Right breaſt, had all the ſtrength, which nature would have ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, conveighed into their right Arm; urging for it the authority of <hi>Hippocrates (lib. de Aëre, aquis, &amp; locis.</hi>) He ſhews a reaſon likewiſe of <hi>Ambidex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> ſaying, that ſuch ſingularity of example comes to paſs, when the bone of the left arm is as heavy as the other; as, we may add, that in whom it is heavier, ſuch perſons become left-handed. And for the generalitie of the tenent concerning the ſtrength of the right-ſide parts, he farther urges the authority of the ſame <hi>Hippocrates (lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Morbis):</hi> who ſurely was a man, as alſo <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> which would not be eaſily cheated with a Tradition. And for mine own part I think that the Opinion of the Ancients was not deliver'd from hand to hand as a bare tradition; but that the more curious and Inquiſitive Men took with them alſo the Morives of the Aſſertion. Which I think may be made good from the learned <hi>Macrobius;</hi> who in his <hi>Saturnals (lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.). handling this Argument delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſcends to the reaſon of this Aſſertion; attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buring it unto the <hi>Liver,</hi> which as he ſays, is <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretus ſanguis,</hi> and <hi>caloris domicilium:</hi> from which Habitation of Heat ſeated on the Right ſide of the body, <hi>quoad majorem partem in dextro hypochondrio,</hi> as <hi>Bartholinus</hi> ſays, in his <hi>Anat. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. is the advantage of the Right-ſide parts, the colder part of the nouriſhment being conveigh'd (to the <hi>left</hi>-ſide) to the <hi>Spleen; nam ideo omnes dextrae partes,</hi> ſays he, <hi>calidiores ſunt, &amp; debiliores ſiniſtra, quia has regit calor viſceris ſui, illae contagione frigoris ſiniſtra obtinentis hebetantur.</hi> Which paſſage though it be read thus even in the lateſt Editions, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Author ſhows plainly, it ſhould be a little mended; as indeed it rightly is by my wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy friend <hi>John Price,</hi> Dr. of the Law, in his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Obſervations</hi> on <hi>Apulcius</hi> his <hi>Apologie.</hi> p. 125. where occaſionally he obſerves and corrects the tranſpoſition of the pronouns in this paſſage of <hi>Macrobius;</hi> and for <hi>has</hi> reads <hi>illas,</hi> and <hi>hae</hi> for <hi>illa;</hi> without which emendation, though ſeeming ſmall, the Author ſhould ſpeak contrary, to what he had ſpoken before. Thus then the Right-ſide parts have an advantage from the Liver, the Left a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage from the Spleen: yet I think not, as ſome, that the Spleen is but the receptacle of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious blood; but that it it <hi>Sanguificationis organum,</hi> preparing blood, though a groſſer, <hi>ad nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trienda viſcera infimi ventris:</hi> whereas the Liver prepares a better blood, and for all the other parts of the body; <hi>as Anatomie</hi> teaches us. The preëmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence then of the Right-ſide parts being an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged truth amongſt the Ancients, was eaſily corrupted into a ſuperſtition; which made them think, That progreſſion only to be in hope <hi>ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> which took its beginning from the <hi>Right</hi> foot.</p>

And how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes he the faſhion of the reckoning, as if it had been made on the one hand with the other? when as there was no ſuch matter, the expreſſions being made on each hand ſingle, and after This manner which follows.

Beſides, to count him the more unhappy, becauſe <hi>His</hi> head was cut-off, and <hi>Theirs</hi> were not, ſeems to Them but weak; for, according to That reaſon, ſay they, even they that dy Crucified, ſhould be accounted more happy. But, to ſpeak gently, let us not crucifie an Author, extending him otherwiſe then he would. Is <hi>Juvenal</hi> the only man that calls <hi>Pompey</hi> unhappy? Or, does he call him ſo for fighting in defence of his Country? or rather becauſe his Cauſe and Merit was not attended with better ſucceſs? Or does he here otherwiſe call <hi>Pompey,</hi> though innocent, unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, then before he did <hi>Neſtor?</hi> whom he propoſed indeed as an example of unhappineſs in old age; yet not becauſe he came againſt <hi>Troy</hi> in behalf of <hi>Greece;</hi> but becauſe comming thither, he was fain to ſee the ſad funeral of his flouriſhing Son, who was ſlain. In like manner the Poet does not compare thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators with <hi>Pompey</hi> in reſpect of their cauſe, but only of the manner and conſequence of their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: in which reſpect he thinks it more unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs (ſetting aſide other reſpects) to die with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided carcaſs, then with a whole one. Nor is this ſpeech without ſufficient reaſon, the whole body being not uſually ſo trivially expoſed to ſcorn, as the head, when divided from the body, has often and wretchedly been, as is well known in the death of <hi>Tully;</hi> as likewiſe of <hi>Galba</hi> (as I have ſhew'd, <hi>Sat.</hi> 6. <hi>Illuſtrat.</hi> 67.) and what degree of this contempt <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi>'s head eſcap'd, was rather by the humanitie of the Conqueror, then of the Executioner. So that in this reſpect even he that died as an ordinary male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour might be term'd leſs unhappy, whiles he fear'd not any thing beyond the execution; and though he endur'd death, yet not a jeer too.

Some report that <hi>Clandius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeal'd the Contract (which may ſeem incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) upon pretence of avoiding by that means ſome dangers, which were ſaid to be portended. See <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> in <hi>Claudius, cap.</hi> 29. Thus, had <hi>Silius</hi> not done this, <hi>Meſſalina</hi> had been his death; and for doing of it, <hi>Claudius</hi> was. But whereas ſome ſay, that if he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd <hi>Meſſalina, Hymen</hi>'s <hi>burning</hi> tapers from her bed ſhould light him to his urne; the Poet makes her rage more ſwift, ſaying he ſhould have died <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> the lightning of the tapers, <hi>pereundum erit ante lucernes.</hi> Beſides, if he had <hi>not</hi> obey'd her, there had been no preparation of <hi>wedding</hi> tapers.</p>

There likewiſe he tells us, that they may be kept without hurt, if they be cover'd in barley. Nor is our age ignorant of ſome ſuch devices; as may be ſeen by <hi>H. Platt,</hi> in his ingenious and delightful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments of the <hi>Art of Preſerving:</hi> where, Number, 64. he ſaies thus; <hi>Cluſters of grapes barging upon lines within a cloſe preſs, will laſt till Eaſter. If they ſhrink, you may plump them up with a little warm water before you eat them. Some uſe to dip the ends of the ſtalks firſt in pitch: ſome cut a branch off the line with every cluſter, placing an apple at each end of the branch, now and then renewing thoſe apples, as they rot; and after, hanging them within a Preſs or Cupboard, which would ſtand in ſuch a place (as I ſuppoſe) where the grapes might not freeze: for otherwiſe you muſt be forced now and then to make a gentle fire in the room, or elſe the grapes will rot and periſh.</hi> The ſame Author in the ſame work, number, 62. ſhews how to have grapes growing all the year, ſaying, <hi>Put a Vine-ſtalk through a basket of Earth in December, which is likely to bear grapes that year, and when the grapes are ripe, cut off the ſtalk under the basket (for by this time it has taken root) keep the basket in a warm place, and the grapes will continue freſh and fair a long time upon the Vine.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:62892:121"/>Palladius</hi> likewiſe [<hi>De Re Ruſtica,</hi> lib. 12. <hi>Tit.</hi> 12.] ſhews how to keep them upon the Vine till the Spring. Now, if the Reader would know how long the grapes here mentioned in our Author, at his ſuppoſed feaſt, had been kept [though not after this laſt manner upon the vine, yet freſh, as if upon the vine] it is apparent, that they had been kept a quarter of a year: for, as <hi>Lubin</hi> notes, this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Perſicus</hi> was <hi>

implying, that the Spring was then ſo forward, as to yield it. Beſides, neer the end of the Satyre he tells his friend, that he thought he heard the ſhouts at the <hi>Megaleſian</hi> Games [in the <hi>Circus:</hi>] which, though he ſpeaks not without an <hi>hyperbole</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>place,</hi> he being then at <hi>Tybur</hi> many miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> as may appear by the cheer, and rural waiters at his Table, yet we may not, without incongruity, ſuppoſe him to ſpeak ſo in reſpect of <hi>Time;</hi> but that it was then the ſeaſon of thoſe Games, which being admitted, it will aptly agree with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſon: thoſe Shews being celebrated on <hi>April</hi> the 4th. and ſome daies after; according to which it will follow, that theſe grapes were kept ſix moneths. Which I the rather thus ſtrictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, to underſtand more perfectly the honeſt and pleaſant skill of the Ancients, and particularly of our vertuous Author, wherewith they employed their innocent privacy. <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s delight may be a little farther underſtood, by <hi>Tybur</hi> [now <hi>Tivoli</hi>] the place of his delight, as it is thus preſented by <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi> in his Theater of the <hi>Italian</hi> Cities, p. 89.</p>

All which exceptions I grant to be learned and ſharpe, yet I think all theſe paſſages may more gently be interpreted; for in the firſt, the Poet ſeems <hi>not</hi> to intend the <hi>property</hi> of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, but the <hi>value;</hi> meaning that ſuch flatterers would promiſe not properly, but as it were a <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catombe,</hi> that is, a Sacrifice as <hi>coſtly</hi> as a <hi>Hecatombe.</hi> In the ſecond likewiſe whiles he mentions the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of the Elephant, he does but Satyrically aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate it, as ſpeaking but according to the people, and ſo jeering at the exceſs. And ſo to the third, he ſpeaks not ſtrictly, but figuratively, calling the Elephant Ivory, as being the Creature that yeilds it: which if it be a bolder expreſſion the Judgment of the Author were a Defence.

Now amongſt the contents, which he puts him in mind of, one and that an eſpecial one is, that no ſuch deceiver ſcapes the ſcourge of his own Conſcience, though he may, ſometimes prevail ſo far, as to avoid the Cenſure of Law by Maſtering the <hi>Praetor</hi>'s urne, that is, by corrupting the <hi>Praetor,</hi> or Judge of the Cauſe. Wherein he implies the manner of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Trials at Law; for the Ordering whereof there was a <hi>Praetor,</hi> unto whom, as aſſiſtants, were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed many Judges, whoſe names being written on little <hi>balls,</hi> were by the <hi>Praetor</hi> caſt into an urne, and being there ſhaken together, the <hi>Praetor</hi> drew out again, as in a Lottery, ſo many as were by Law, according to the nature of the Cauſe, account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted fit and neceſſary.

This being done the Judges appointed and which accepted of the trouble (for in ſome caſes they were allowed their excuſe) took an oath to judge according to the Law: but on diverſe occaſions others were often ſubſtituted for them by the <hi>Praetor.</hi> Likewiſe after the Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cauſe the <hi>Praetor</hi> gave to eac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

In which point of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, I may only add, that whereas it is often im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that the names of the Judges were written upon <hi>balls,</hi> as the learned <hi>Dempſter</hi> on <hi>Roſinus (lib.</hi> 9.) ſhews out of <hi>Propertius (lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Eleg.</hi> 12.) according to <hi>Paſſeratius</hi> his expoſition, as alſo out of <hi>Aſconius Paedianus:</hi> yet there were alſo upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion other Lots uſed by the <hi>Praetor</hi> of different <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>form;</hi> as may appear from the Fragments of ſome old Laws publiſh'd and Entitled, <hi>Leges &amp; Senatus Conſulta, quae; in veteribus cum ex Eapide, tum ex. aere monumentis reperiuntur:</hi> in one of which are theſe words, — IS.

For though he adds, that it had a name from no metal, it will not follow, that though there were more then four metals, there were therefore eight. But <hi>Lubin</hi> expounds it more plainly, ſaying that the Poet reckons here the number of the Ages, not after the <hi>Roman</hi> but the <hi>Graecian</hi> manner; and ſo accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly reckons-up eight metals, namely Gold, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, <hi>Electrum.</hi> (a mixture of Gold and Silver) Braſs, Copper; Lead, Tinne, Iron: and ſo by conſequence the age worſe then Iron, muſt be the <hi>Ninth</hi> age; which as he ſays, may be called <hi>Terrea</hi> or <hi>Lutea;</hi> beſides, ſays he, of ſimple numbers the <hi>Ninth</hi> is the Laſt. In which reckoning he is fain to ſtrain to make the metals reach to eight; <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrum</hi> being but taken upon courteſie, and <hi>Copper</hi> being but a kind of braſs, <hi>as Cyprium.</hi> (and ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Cuprum</hi>) a Braſs which they have in <hi>Cyprus.</hi> Beſides, methinks, it is a againſt the Poet himſelf, who in the beginning of the Sixt <hi>Satyre</hi> intimates the number of the ages, and after the ordinary <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> manner: and therefore it is not likely, that he would now here imply it after another ſo different a manner. They then that ſhall diſlike this Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is ſo liable to ſuſpition, may take that of <hi>Pithoeus, Nunc aetas agitur;</hi> and avoid the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid difficulty. For indeed though <hi>Lubin</hi> makes hard ſhift to make-up the number of the metals, yet I think it but a ſhift; as it may appear by his placing <hi>ferrum</hi> laſt of all, and by his telling us, that <hi>ferrum metallorum ultimum:</hi> which he but added to help his expoſition, becauſe the Poet ſaid that it was worſe then Iron, and the Ninth. But he might have remember'd, that in the fixt <hi>Satyre,</hi> where the Poet mentions the Ages by the metals, he does not make ſuch a diſtance between the Silver and the Iron ages, ſaying <hi>Omne alind, crimen mox ferrea protulit aetas:</hi> where the word <hi>mox</hi> ſhews that it was not long after; whereas <hi>Lubin</hi> makes no leſs then five ages, according to the number of ſo many me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, between the Silver and Iron ages. According therefore to <hi>Pithaeus</hi> his Reading, <hi>Naâ aetas agitur,</hi> I chooſe to render it, Theſe our Times, Our age, is worſe then th' Ir'n one—. And if the Plenty of the expreſſion in the ſeveral words, <hi>aetas, ſecula,</hi> and <hi>tempora</hi> uſed here ſhould ſeem an overplus, the ſharper ſight of the Critick may peradventure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſome difference between them, taking <hi>eatas</hi> for
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:62892:133"/>the ordinary age of 60 or 70 years, and <hi>ſecula</hi> for 100 years, as often they are taken; and <hi>tempora</hi> for a larger and <hi>indefinite</hi> time, to ſhew the diffus'd corruption of times and manners.

But then more tartly he quips <hi>Calvinus,</hi> telling him that he were very young (though threeſcore) and ſo worthy to wear the boſſe, the mark of childhood, (of which ſee <hi>Perſius, Sat.</hi> 5.) if he were ſo ſimple as to think, that when men offer'd at the Altars of the Gods, making them red with the blood of their ſacrifice, ſome Deity were there preſent to take notice of their devotion.

Or Bees like a long grape-bunch ſettle on ſome Temple's top.—<hi>Examenve apium longa conſederit ava Culmine-delubri.</hi>— The Poet, in the reprehenſion of his Times, ſays, that it was a wonder, if one that was truſted with a purſe of money, reſtor'd the purſe, with all the coin now grown ruſty. Nay, ſuch honeſty, ſays he, were a prodigie, which might require the <hi>Aruſpices</hi> to ſearch all the books of their Art (which they firſt learn'd of the <hi>Taſcans</hi>) that ſo they might both know what it portended, as alſo how to take order to make due expiation for it, as by ſacrificing a lamb adorned with a garland, as the manner was. He profeſſes indeed, that he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted an honeſt man as rare a wonder, as Fiſh unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly turn'd up by ſome husband-man's won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring plow <hi>(miranti aratro;)</hi> or like a Mule, which naturally being barren, ſhould yet become fruitful; or like a ſwarm of bees, which ſhould ſettle in the form of a bunch of grapes, upon ſome Temple. For <hi>uva</hi> is not here to be taken properly, for a <hi>grape,</hi> but for <hi>borrus,</hi> or <hi>racemus,</hi> a <hi>cluſter</hi> of grapes: ſince a ſwarm does not ſettle in the faſhion of a grape, which is round; but in the faſhion of a bunch of grapes, which is long, and ſmaller at one end. Yet this is not the thing which is here point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, this being the nature and cuſtome of bees: but the wonder here intended, and therefore to be noted, to prevent miſtake, is not in the <hi>form,</hi> but in the <hi>place</hi> of their ſetling; it being accounted omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, in the <hi>Roman</hi> ſuperſtition, for Bees to ſettle on the top of an <hi>Houſe,</hi> or of a <hi>Temple;</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. or upon an <hi>Altar,</hi> or on the <hi>Enſign</hi> in an Army, as it happened to <hi>Pompey</hi> before the <hi>Pharſalian</hi> battel; or on <hi>Ships,</hi> as it happened to <hi>Dion,</hi> as <hi>Plutarch</hi> relates; or in a <hi>Camp,</hi> as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell <hi>Brutus.</hi> See <hi>Tiraquell</hi> on <hi>Alex. ab Alex. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.

It is deſcribed by <hi>Tacitus, de Moribus Germanerum;</hi> of whom he ſays, <hi>Rari gladiis aut majoribus lanceis utuntur, haſtas vel ipſorum vocabulo frameas gerunt, angaſto &amp; brevi ferro, ſed ita acri &amp; ad uſum habili, ut codem telo, prout rutio poſcit, vel cominus vel eminus pugnent.</hi> So that a Sword it was not, as <hi>Lipſius</hi> alſo notes on that place; but rather a javelin (<hi>ſpieſse,</hi> ſays <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſins.</hi>) The Poet adds, how that ſuch Perjurers, if they had children, did not fear to wiſh unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that if they were guilty, the miſeries of <hi>Thyeſtes</hi> might happen to them; that is, that their dear ſons might be murder'd, and inſteed of food, be ſerv'd up to them with <hi>Pharian,</hi> that is, <hi>Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> vinegar, which was noted for the ſpecial ſharpneſs of it, as by <hi>Martial,</hi> and likewiſe by <hi>Athenans, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. and here added as an ironical aggravation.

The Poet ſpeaking-on in the language of the coveteous <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts</hi> of thoſe times, ſays, what are all the plagues, which the Gods commonly in this life inflict, in compariſon of mony? True it is, that <hi>Ladas</hi> was famous for his ſwiftneſs of foot, but the poor fellow would have been glad to have had the rich gout, or elſe for certain he wanted a ſound brain, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was fit to have been ſent to <hi>Anticyra,</hi> where he might have had <hi>Hellebore</hi> good ſtore, to have purg'd his brain from madneſs, or to have been committed to the famous <hi>Archigenes,</hi> no meaner a <hi>Phyſitian</hi> being equal to ſuch a Cure. For, alas, what was it to win the Race, and having a hungry belly, to be rewarded with Fame and a Garland of an Olive-branch? For, ſuch was the manner near <hi>Piſa</hi> in <hi>Elis,</hi> where in a large field called <hi>Olympia,</hi> as <hi>Britannicus</hi> notes; the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games were ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated, and called ſo from <hi>Jupiter Olympicus,</hi> who had a Temple near adjoining, where alſo ſay ſome was a hill call'd <hi>Olympus,</hi> but not the famous Hill <hi>Olympus,</hi> as ſome have miſtaken, this being between <hi>Theſſaly</hi> and <hi>Macedonia:</hi> but the <hi>Games</hi> were cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in <hi>Peloponeſus,</hi> in the <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Greece.</hi> Our Poet goes on ſaying, that thus do your perjur'd perſons pleaſe themſelvs; nay, and are ſo bold in forſwearing, that by their meer confidence they ſeem innocent; like the Mimick, who in <hi>Catullus</hi> his play called <hi>Phaſma</hi> (or, the <hi>viſion</hi>) repreſents a

Which ſtory in effect, with a little va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation, is in the fable of <hi>Don Quixot;</hi> where the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Author <hi>Michael Cervantes</hi> makes <hi>Sancho Panca,</hi> whom he preſents for an Ideot, and upon a time, the decider of ſuch a controverſie, to command the ſtaff to be broken, thus artributing the ſingularity of the diſcovery, not to that way of providence mentioned by the <hi>Hiſtorian,</hi> but to the ſtrange illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the ſoul, which are, as he purpoſes to conclude, beſtowd at certain ſeaſons even on mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. The variety does a little help to excuſe the borrowing without acknowledgment in ſuch a work of profeſſed invention: and indeed, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and plentiful wit might have omitted it, but that his Anceſtors, <hi>Virgil,</hi> and ſuch others, hearten their poſterity as well to borrow, as to imitate. But our Poet going on, ſays, that ſuch perjuries make many men, who thus loſe their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, to loſe almoſt their wits alſo: for this, ſays he, makes thee likewiſe, <hi>Calvinus,</hi> to cry out like <hi>Stentor,</hi> who could cry as loud as 50 men; or like <hi>Mars</hi> when wounded by <hi>Diomedes,</hi> as loud as ten thouſand men (as even the Poet <hi>Homer</hi> tell us, <hi>Iliad.</hi> 5.) and it makes thee to ſay to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> Hold'ſt thou thy peace at theſe crimes, ſuffering us to be thus abuſed by Perjury? Is it for this, that we bring our Incenſe and Sacrifices to thee?

Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, the Poet would then here mean, why elſe do we, when we remove, or take away our fix'd ſcrowls of paper (wherein our vows are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten) from the knees of the Gods, bring, inſtead of them, the offrings themſelves, which we have vow'd; as Incenſe, a Calf's liver, and an hog's cawl? Which expoſition I believing to be the better, do accordingly render it, — <hi>Why elſe Vow-ſcrowls Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd, falls our free incenſe on thy coals?</hi> But, becauſe <hi>Rutgerſius,</hi> though he largely ſhews the cuſtom of fixing, removing, and performing vows, yet only affirms, that he believes it to be here alluded to, I think it neceſſary, ſince I chooſe his opinion, to ſhew what motives induced me to it. Firſt then, the common expoſition ſeems trivial and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; for, had it not been enough to ſay, <hi>Why do we bring our incenſe,</hi> but to mention ſuch a petty, yea, a ridiculous circumſtance, ſaying, <hi>why do we open our papers, and thence pour our incenſe on your coals?</hi> But, ſecondly, to ſuppoſe that they brought their incenſe to the Altars in <hi>papers,</hi> and thence ſprinkled in into the fire, is far below the ſtate of ſacred pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, ſuch as were needful for all occaſions, in the ſervice of the Gods, who might not be ſerved, even in the ſuperſtition of thoſe times, with ſuch mercenary and unhallowed appurtenances. Laſtly, to ſpeak from Antiquity, there was no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the bringing of their incenſe in papers to the altars; there being, for that purpoſe, an incenſe-<hi>pan,</hi> called <hi>acerra,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Perſius, Sat.</hi> 2. which was commonly for the poorer ſort; out of which they took a few grains, with three of their fingers, or ſometimes with two: yet ſometimes the rich alſo uſed the <hi>acerra,</hi> which then was <hi>fill'd;</hi> and ſo they poured the incenſe into the fire. But properly the <hi>Lanx</hi> (or, Charger) was for the uſe of the Rich: according to which ſize and plenty, <hi>Datis,</hi> one of the Governours under <hi>Darius,</hi> poured on the Altar of <hi>Apollo</hi> 300 pound weight of incenſe, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> relates it, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. But it is enough on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to mention this point, it being largely proved by <hi>Theodorus Marcilius</hi> on <hi>Perſius, Sat.</hi> 2. in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of thoſe words, <hi>tacita acerra.</hi> One doubt more there is yet in this paſſage of <hi>Juvenal,</hi> about <hi>Bathyllus,</hi> to whom the Gods are here jeeringly compar'd, and to whom, though he was but a fool, as the <hi>Scholiast</hi> ſays, (by whom the name is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Vagellus</hi>) or rather as ſome think, a young and dainty <hi>Muſitian,</hi> there was a ſtatue erected by <hi>Polycrates</hi> in the Iſland <hi>Samos,</hi> and placed even in the Temple of <hi>Juno.</hi> And this is the perſon more probably here intended; the purpoſe here being not to liken the Gods to the fool <hi>Vagellus,</hi> but more conveniently to a man vainly improved into the condition of a God, having, as well as the Deity, a ſtatue in a Temple. Indeed, ſays this abuſed Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor, there is little or no difference between them; there being no more help or juſtice in the occaſions and neceſſities of life, to be expected from the one than from the other.</p>

Yet here <hi>Caelius Secundus Curio</hi> obſerves out of <hi>Pliny,</hi> that the vultur neſtes not in Trees, but on high Rocks; though he himſelf makes anſwer, that it may be on Trees growing on high Rocks, as we may ſee them, ſays he, often grow.

And is not he as mad, though he rears not his clothes off his back, who for wealth, which he has not, will loſe that which he has, and perchance in a tempeſt be put to ſwim for his life, and inſtead of 1000 talents which he madly hoped for, be glad to ſave his poor purſe in his left hand, whiles he helps himſelf with his right, or, in neceſſity of ſtronger ſwimming, ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly in his mouth, ſo to ſave himſelf by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of both hands? And yet, ſays he, after his eſcape, though lamentable, he muſt be glad to ſee himſelf ſtill in a painted tempeſt, it being the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner after ſuch calamity, to carry at their back the picture of their ſhip-wrack, ſo to procure compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and relief. In which expreſſion, to lay ſome ſmaller obſervations together, we may a little more take notice of ſome things, and in the order they are touch'd by the Poet. Firſt then concerning <hi>Calpe,</hi> we may hear <hi>Priſcian</hi> [in His way of Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation] making a Grammar-wonder, that <hi>Juvenal</hi> makes the laſt ſyllable of that ablative ſhort; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the nature of <hi>Penelope, Arachne,</hi> and the like, alwaies long. Yet <hi>Coelius Secundus Curio</hi> ſhews, that likewiſe <hi>Ruffus Feſtus</hi> the Interpreter of <hi>Aratus</hi> makes it ſhort: beſides, others think, that in this place this word is of the third declenſion; ſo that though there be ordinarily <hi>Calpe, Calpes,</hi> yet there is alſo <hi>Calpis, Calpas;</hi> from whence the word here uſed deſcends. But ſetting aſide this ſomewhat neceſſary nicety, we may next take notice of that ancient phanſie, which was greatly entertain'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Sun's noiſe at his ſetting; Antiquity thinking when it went down in the weſtern Ocean, as they conceiv'd, that it made a noiſe like burning iron, when dipped in water. Nor was this a vanity only in the People, but alſo in the Poets; [as might be plentifully ſhew'd] nay, in <hi>Poſſidonius</hi> a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher [as <hi>Strabo</hi> teſtifies] and in <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf, as <hi>Rhodigine</hi> nores, <hi>lib.</hi> 24. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.

And here it may be farther noted, that the Weſtern [or <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantique</hi> Ocean] into which, Antiquity thought that the Sun did every night deſcend, is in the margine of one Manuſcript, called <hi>Mare mortuum,</hi> as alſo by the <hi>Scholiaſt,</hi> who adds <hi>ultra quod navigare non conce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditur:</hi> which he might with pardon call ſo [by way of it ſeeming till late diſcoveries, to be as dead, whiles without that lively motion, at leaſt, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which in other Seas is beheld: but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, to take it for that which is uſually called <hi>Maye mortuum</hi> [once the place vvhere the unhappy Cities were deſtroy'd by fire from Heaven] were a miſtake, of extent more than the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea. But from the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi>'s addition, the learned <hi>Pigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> probably collects (in his <hi>Symbol. Epiſt.</hi> 14.) that this Sea was not diſcovered by the Ancients, or, as he ſays, untill <hi>Columbus.</hi> Thirdly, we may obſerve, that when it is ſaid, that the vain Merchant at his return <hi>tumida ſuperbus aluta, proud of his ſwoln bags,</hi> (for ſo commonly, and, as I think, rightly it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded) <hi>Lubin</hi> offers another expoſition alſo, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us, that <hi>oluta</hi> may be taken for the ſails of the ſhip, becauſe the <hi>Galli</hi> are ſaid by <hi>Caeſar</hi> to have had ſails of ſuch taw'd leather.

For ſo indeed, according to ſome, they ador'd the bird <hi>Ibis,</hi> for eating the eggs of Serpents, which infeſt their Countrey; and for deſtroying ſnakes, as ſome tell us, which are blown from the <hi>Lybian</hi> Sands to <hi>Aegypt</hi> by the <hi>Eaſt</hi>-wind; but I ſuppoſe they ſhoul have ſaid, by the <hi>Weſt</hi> wind, <hi>Lybia</hi> lying Weſt from <hi>Aegypt.</hi> They worſhip alſo, which may ſeem more ſtrange, even the <hi>Crocodile,</hi> though he devours men; becauſe he kills the Robbers (<hi>Lybians</hi> and <hi>Arabians</hi>) which uſe to ſwim over the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> ſpoiling and murdring the Inhabitants. <hi>Nigidius Figulus,</hi> that famous <hi>Roman,</hi> anciently equalled, for his learning, with <hi>Varro,</hi> does in his <hi>Fragments</hi> (collected by <hi>Rutgerſius,</hi> in his <hi>Var.

                        <pb n="272" facs="tcp:62892:147"/>did thus ſhadow their <hi>Theologie:</hi> becauſe the Divinity paſſed not only through man, but alſo through all the Creatures. With which degree of gueſs at the chief grounds of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Religion, we muſt reſt ſatisfied: though pity it was, that Poſterity is deprived of the books of the <hi>Phoenitian</hi> and <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Theologie, written ſo long ſince by <hi>Sanconiathon,</hi> a <hi>Tyrian</hi> Philoſopher and <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> [as <hi>Suidas</hi> tells us; though <hi>Porphyry</hi> makes him a <hi>Bery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi>] who is ſaid to have lived before the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Troy, in the time of <hi>Semiramis,</hi> and of whom mention is made by <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his <hi>Evangelical Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations [lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. and 10. and <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.] as alſo by <hi>Theodoret, Suidas,</hi> and Others: who tell us, that he writ the <hi>Phoenician</hi> ſtory in that language; which afterwards was tranſlated by <hi>Philo Biblius.</hi> Yet there wants not ſtore of Others, that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſupply ſuch interpretation of their myſteries; as <hi>Jamblichus, Plutarch, Euſebius [De Prap.

But here we may farther ſee in our Poet's Cenſure and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> madneſs, the variety of Idolaters at enmity againſt themſelves? And, alas, the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Graecians</hi> did but Think Themſelves ſafe in their way of worſhip, though they raiſed their defence to the daz'ling height of Reaſon: as may be ſeen in <hi>Julian</hi>'s <hi>Fragment</hi> of an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by <hi>Petavius</hi> [p. 534.] where he ſays, Our Anceſtors made Images, and other ſigns, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the Gods, — <gap reason="foreign">

To which we may add what the elegant <hi>Platoniſt, Maximus</hi> the <hi>Tyrian</hi> has in his <hi>Diſſertation.</hi> 38. where purpoſely and largely he handles this argument; pleaſantly alſo cenſuring the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> devotion, ſaying, that in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> The Gods die, and are mourn'd for: that There you may ſee their Temples and their Sepulchres; that there they offer to them Tears and Honours. And to ſhew the ſure, though ill-grounded ſuperſtition of them in this belief, he tells a ſtory of an <hi>Aegyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> woman, which nouriſh'd a young crocodile: whereupon, the reſt of the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> thought her a moſt happy woman, and the nurſe of their God, and not a few ſought to pleaſe both Her and her Darling. He adds, that this woman had a young ſon about the age of her God, whoſe play fellow he was; and that, whiles for tenderneſs of body the God crocodile ſeem'd rame, all was well: but that when ſtrength came to him, his nature came to him, and [though he had ſpoil'd his own ſport] he eat up his play-fellow: that the mother not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, though indeed wrerched, rejoyced at the death of her child, as moſt happy, being ſo honoured as to be made the ſacrifice of her houſe-God. Whether the mother her ſelf alſo were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards ſo honoured or not by her Live Idol, the Author tells us not; but by this we may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee their dreadful devotion! Which may make leſs our wonder at a ſtory in <hi>Diodorus</hi> (a witneſs of the fact,) who relates, that when <hi>Ptolomy</hi> enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the <hi>Romans,</hi> and was declared their Friend, a <hi>Roman</hi> having but accidentally killed a <hi>Cat,</hi> was ſo aſſaulted by the bloody ſuperſtition of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that neither the Kings Officers ſent for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, not the terrour of the <hi>Romans,</hi> though at that time ſo great, were able to reſcue him.

                        </gap>, that there was neither ſuch encouragement to the Souldier, nor conſequently, ſuch juſtice in the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Yet this I grant, that in this Satyre there is not ſuch rowling eloquence, as generally flows in the reſt: which yet I will not attribute to his old age [though it is clear that he writ it in his old age] becauſe at that ſeaſon of his liſe, he writ alſo the 15th. Satyre: which does not yield to any for an admirable expreſſion of natural compaſſion. Wherefore I think moſt conveniently, that it was ſome <hi>firſt draught</hi> or <hi>deſign</hi> of a Satyre intended by our Author, and ſo a True one, not a Perfect one. The occaſion of this Satyre is thought to have been our Poet's employment into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whither, it is ſaid, he was ſent under the pretence and honour of ſome Military ſervice, but indeed, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, for jeering at <hi>Paris,</hi> though but a Player, yet <hi>Domitian</hi>'s favourite: who, as it is ſaid, <hi>Sat.</hi> 8. was able to beſtow Offices, as Praefectures and the like. But whereas <hi>Lubin</hi> thinks that our Poet writ this, when he was fourſcore years of age, I belive he much miſtakes, or elſe he muſt aſſign unto him a very long life. For though we ſhould ſuppoſe that he writ not, at leaſt, not publiſh'd this, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void danger, till <hi>Domitlan</hi>'s death [which was eleven years after this Service, and <hi>Junius</hi> his Conſulſhi and not till then reckon our Poet to be 80 years of age, it would follow, that he lived an 100 years [which I know none that offer to affirm] ſince he himſelf mentions <hi>threeſcore</hi> years from <hi>Fonteius</hi> his Conſulſhip (<hi>Anno urbis Conditae,</hi> 811.) which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber reaches from <hi>thence</hi> to the <hi>Third</hi> year of <hi>Adrian, A.V.C.</hi> 871. between which and <hi>Domitian</hi>'s death are above 20 years, namely, the reign both of <hi>Nerva</hi> and <hi>Trajan;</hi> which ſhould by that account be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the former 80.

His father <hi>Flaccus</hi> (whoſe other names we find not mention'd) was a <hi>Roman</hi> Knight, as in his time out Poet alſo; who was born in the XXI. year of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> the day before the <hi>Nones</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> that is, the fourth; in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Lucius Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Fabius Perſicus</hi> (not <hi>Priſcus,</hi> as <hi>Helvicus</hi> has it) as it appears in the old <hi>Gloſs,</hi> where his Life is publiſh'd by the learned <hi>Pithaenus,</hi> as alſo in the accurate edition of the <hi>Faſti Conſulares</hi> publiſh'd by <hi>Dionyſius Gothofrod.</hi> At his fathers death he was left young, not fully ſix years old. His Mother <hi>Fulvia Siſennia</hi> afterwards married one <hi>Fuſius</hi> a Roman Knight, and within a few years buried Him alſo. Our Poet ſtudied till he was twelve years of age at <hi>Volaterrae;</hi> after that at <hi>Rome,</hi> under the inſtruction of <hi>Remmius Palaemon</hi> a <hi>Grammarian,</hi> and <hi>Virginius Flaccus</hi> a <hi>Rhetorician.</hi> When he was XVI. years old he grew ſo acquainted with <hi>Annaeus Cornutus</hi> (by Country an <hi>African,</hi> by profeſſion a <hi>Stoick</hi> Philoſopher) that he never after left his friendſhip; and from him had a moderate introduction into Philoſophy. His friends from his youth were <hi>Caeſius Baſſus</hi> a Lyrick Poet; and <hi>Calpurnius Sura,</hi> who died a youth in <hi>Perſius</hi> his life time. <hi>Servilius Novianus</hi> he reverenced as a father. By <hi>Cornutus</hi> his means he became acquainted alſo with <hi>Annaeus Lucan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For at that time <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> was a writer of Tragedies, and left behind him divers Books of Philoſophy. But <hi>Lucanus</hi> ſo admir'd the writings of <hi>Flaccus,</hi> that hearing him read his verſes, he could ſcarce contain from crying out publickly, that they were abſolute Poems. It was late e're he fell into the acquaintance of <hi>Seneca,</hi> but not late e're he fell into an admiration of his wit. Living with <hi>Cornutus</hi> he us'd the familiarity of two moſt learned and vertuous Men, and at that time ſharp Philoſophers, <hi>Claudius Agaternus</hi> a <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> Phyſitian, and <hi>Petronius Ariſtocrates</hi> a Magneſian, whom he ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly admir'd and imitated, they being Contempories and <hi>Cornutus</hi> his juniors. He was almoſt for ten years highly beloved by <hi>Poetus Thraſeus,</hi> ſo that ſometimes he
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62892:155"/>travel'd with him; <hi>Thraſeas</hi> having married <hi>Perſius</hi> his Kinſwoman <hi>Arria.</hi> As for his Poems, he writ in his Childhood a Book call'd <hi>Praetexta,</hi> concerning the Gown which Noblemen's Sons wore; another of his <hi>Journies;</hi> and (if we gueſs the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Gloſs</hi> into ſenſe) ſome verſes upon <hi>Arria,</hi> that kill'd her ſelf before her Husband. All which were aboliſh'd by the Counſel and Perſuaſion of <hi>Cornutus</hi> to <hi>Perſius</hi> his Mother after his Death. He writ ſeldom and ſlowly, though betimes in reſpect of his beginning to write, For as ſoon as he left his Maſter's School, having read the tenth Book of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> he did earneſtly endeavor to write Satyres; the beginning of whoſe book he did imitate, quipping himſelf firſt, and afterwards all others, with ſuch an inſectation of the new Poets and Orators, that he ſpar'd not <hi>Nero:</hi> againſt whom one verſe running thus, <hi>Midas the King has Aſſes cars—,</hi> was by <hi>Cornutus</hi> thus only amended, <hi>who has not Aſſes rars?</hi> leaſt <hi>Nero</hi> ſhould take it as ſpoken againſt himſelf. But this Book he left unperfect; beſides, ſome verſes are thought to be taken away in the end of the work: yet as if it had been finiſh'd, it is ſaid, he curſorily recited it to <hi>Cornutus;</hi> and to <hi>Caeſius Baſſus,</hi> to whom at his deſire, he deliver'd it to be publiſh'd: and as ſoon as it came forth; it began by all men to be admir'd and catch'd-up. As for his conditions, he was of a moſt gentle nature, a maidenly modeſty, a diſcreet thriſt; and for Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Mother, Siſter and Aunt, enough for an Example. He died of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of his ſtomack, at his Country-houſe about eight miles from <hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>Appian</hi> way; on the VIII. day of the Calends of <hi>December,</hi> that is, <hi>November</hi> the XXIV. in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Publius Marius Celſus</hi> (not of <hi>Rubrius Marius,</hi> as it is in the <hi>Gloſs</hi>) and of <hi>Lucius Aſinius Gallus,</hi> as it is in the accurate <hi>Gothofreds</hi> edition (not <hi>Publius Afinius Gallus,</hi> as it is in <hi>Helvicus.</hi> Which year of theſe mens Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulſhips (and <hi>Perſius</hi> his death) <hi>Helvicus</hi> places in the ninth year of <hi>Nero:</hi> which is ſtrictly true, reckoning, as he muſt, from the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s raign, which was in <hi>October</hi> the XIII. For ſo <hi>Perſius</hi> dying <hi>November</hi> the XXIV. outliv'd the eighth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> about ſix weeks. Which I the rather note, becauſe <hi>Gotho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi> places theſe Conſuls (and ſo the year of <hi>Perſius</hi> his death muſt be placed) in the eighth year of <hi>Nero,</hi> reck'ning according to the beginning of the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s year, which was on <hi>January</hi> the firſt. Thus reckning from <hi>October</hi> the XIII. to <hi>January</hi> I. which was the begining of <hi>Nero</hi>'s raign, unto the laſt year of <hi>Claudius</hi> his predeceſſor, he allows unto <hi>Claudius</hi> XIV. years, whereas <hi>Helvicus</hi> allows but XIII. which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference being obſerv'd, upon different ways of account, may ſave the Reader from miſtake both of the exact truth, and of the learned Authors. Hence we may take notice of the error in the old <hi>Gloſs</hi> in our Authors Life; in which it is ſaid, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, that he died in the XXX. year of his Age, when as it was in the XXVIII. ſome few days before the end of it, according to the reckning of the Conſulſhips in the ſame <hi>Gloſs.</hi> Which may clearly thus appear; there were but XXVII. years between the <hi>Conſuls</hi> under whom he was born, and thoſe under whom he died, as is manifeſt by the <hi>Faſti Conſulares.</hi> Now the time our Author liv'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the firſt <hi>Conſuls,</hi> was but from <hi>Decemb.</hi> the IV. till <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. and the time he lived under the laſt <hi>Conſuls,</hi> was but from <hi>Jan.</hi> 1. till <hi>November</hi> XXIV. both which par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of time make not up a compleat year, though but about IX. days leſs. As for the diſpoſal of his Eſtate, the old <hi>Gloſs</hi> tells us, that he left to his Mother and Siſter about H-SXX. or <hi>Seſtertium vicies,</hi> two millions of <hi>Seſtertji,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> valew ariſing to 15625<abbr>l.</abbr> (as I have by proportion ſhew'd on <hi>Juvenal, Sat.</hi> 6. <hi>Illuſt.</hi> 17.) deſiring his Mother (by his Letter) to give unto <hi>Cornutus,</hi> as ſome relate it, <hi>ſeſtertia conties,</hi> ten Millions of <hi>Seſtertii,</hi> that is, 78125<abbr>l.</abbr> 
                     <hi>Engliſh.</hi> But the <hi>Gloſs</hi> is in theſe ſums too probably to be ſuſpected of corruption; both for the valews of the ſums,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:62892:155"/>and the leſs ſeemly diviſion, implyed in his deſire, by which five times as much was intended for <hi>Cornutus,</hi> as for his Mother and Siſter. It is added indeed, that ſome report, he left to his Maſter only XX. pound weight in ſilver Plate (which in ſumme, at 3<abbr>l.</abbr> 2<abbr>s.</abbr> for one pound weight in ſilver comes to 62?) beſides 700. books, being his whole Library; but that his Maſter took only the Books, which I think the moſt probable; <hi>Cornutus,</hi> as <hi>Suidas</hi> tells us of him, being a man of a great Eſtate. To theſe Memorials of our Author, which upon examination Antiquity has left unto us, we may adde, what will not be unpleaſant, the Portraiture of one Poet, as it is preſented by the inquiſitive diligence of the learned <hi>Ormeer</hi> (in his <hi>Chronographie</hi>) and thus preſented.

                     <hi>Stelluti</hi> (one that has publiſh'd his <hi>Italian</hi> tranſlation of <hi>Perſius,</hi> in the year 1630.) has alſo a comely expreſſion of him from an ancient Marble, with a laurel about the head; but in the countenance with little difference, this being ſomewhat of a bolder aſpect; that ſomewhat baſhful: which quality, I grant, is attributed to him in the old Gloſs; but the different ſeaſons of his Life, and ſo riper age, might eaſily more man his countenance, and preſent him with more of the courage of the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; this therefore I retein. This learned <hi>Stelluti</hi> tells us more concerning the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of the <hi>Flaccian</hi> family, that there is yet in <hi>Volaterrae,</hi> at the Gate of St. <hi>Angelo,</hi> in an Antient Marble, a memorial of one of this family, with this Inſcription, <hi>A. Perſius A. F. Sever. vix. An.</hi> XIII. <hi>M.</hi> III. <hi>d.</hi> XIX. He tells us, that he thinks, that the ancient family of the <hi>Falconcini</hi> (corruptly ſo called for <hi>Flacconcini</hi>) now flouriſhing at <hi>Volaterrae,</hi> are deſcended from our Poets Anceſtors: which he teſtifies to be the receiv'd tradition of the <hi>Volaterrans</hi> at this time; adding, that in memory of our Poet, they have preſerv'd his name in ſome one of the family for
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:62892:156"/>time out of mind. And for the more laſting honour of out Poet in his kindred, he relates, that at the time he publiſh'd his tranſlation (in the year abovementio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, 1630) there were ſome eminent men living, of our Poets name and family. He mentions one <hi>Signor Perſio Falconcini</hi> famous for Learning and Valour, and Sectetary to the Duke of <hi>Florence;</hi> as alſo a Brother of his, one <hi>Onerato, Prior</hi> of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> who as he witneſſes, has written a learned Tract, <hi>Del Bever Caldo,</hi> (of the hot Draughts of the Ancients) as alſo, 18. books, <hi>De recta ratione Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophandi;</hi> which, he ſays, were ſhortly to ſee the Light; beſides 12. other books of his, <hi>De Natura Ignis &amp; Caloris:</hi> which works he highly praiſes for the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, Invention and Benefit unto the Students of all Sciences, giving to the Author the large honour of a Divine, a Philoſopher, a Mathematician, a Phyſitian and a Lawyer. All which he mentions to ſhew that the Deſcendents of our Poets kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred do not degenerate even to theſe times from their Anceſtors. Upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of which relations, methinks we cannot but acknowledge the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in thus famouſly hououring the vertue of this Heathen, in cauſing his Name and Kindred to be ſtill thus ſtudiouſly and nobly preſerv'd. His Country alſo may be his honour, to which he was an honour; a Country of ſuch inquiſitive Contemplation, that the Theology of their Augury ſeem'd ſcarce more a miſtake then an excuſe. And as Heathen <hi>Volaterrae</hi> exceeded <hi>Rome</hi> in this Art; ſo did a <hi>Volaterran</hi> prevent, and ſo exceed it, in the glory of Chriſtianity; <hi>Linus</hi> (not a <hi>Roman,</hi> but) <hi>a Volaterran</hi> being not only a Chriſtian, but, after the Apoſtles time, the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> its ſelf, (which was not above five or ſix years after our Poets time) and happy <hi>Linus</hi> at laſt made his Death exceed his Life, by the zeal and glory of Martyrdome. And now I need not farther celebrate our Poets worth, then by mentioning ſome, by whom it has been celebrated; whiles recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; namely <hi>Quintilian, Martial, Cenſorinus, Priſcian, Diomedes, Servius, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pridius, Caſsiodore, Lactantius, Euſebius,</hi> St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> VVith which Elogy I leave him in a Suprene degree of Nature and Fame; having by his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue made himſelf a Founder and Repairer of his <hi>Volaterrae.</hi>

The body was waſh'd and Anointed; the Rich with coſtly ointments, ſuch as <hi>amomum</hi> yielded; which was a ſhrub growing in <hi>Armenia,</hi> and ſome other Eaſtern parts; from the uſe of which, in the embalming of the dead, ſome think the word <hi>Mumy</hi> to be deriv'd. The body was decently covered, and laid upon an high biere, and placed ready to be carried forth; and a coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of flowers ſet upon it. Wax-candles alſo were carried before it to the funeral fire.

Before the Corps of an Honourable Perſon there went anciently in order many Chariots, according to the number of their famous Progenitors: on each of which was a bed with an Image of one of them; and oftentimes they were no ſmall number; there being at the funeral of <hi>Marcellus,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Octavia Auguſtus</hi> his ſiſter, no ſewer than ſix hundred ſuch beds placed on ſo many Chariots with ſo many Images on them, as <hi>Marcilius</hi> here notes. But the Corps it ſelf was not carried on a Chariot, but on the ſhoulders of ſome of the Great man's ſervants made free. Before all theſe went <hi>Lictors</hi> carrying the <hi>faſces</hi> (the rod and are) with ſuch other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments as belong'd to ſuch Honourable Offices, as in their life they had enjoyed. This may aptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member us of a leſs, yet a great Inſtance, of the ſtately funeral of <hi>Stephen Gardiner,</hi> ſometimes Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> a man of ſhrewd wiſdome, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent learning (I intend only his Civil Abilities;) a ſolemnity not ſutable to the ſon of his pretended father; but (as may be ſeen in <hi>Brook</hi>'s <hi>Catalogue</hi> publiſhed by <hi>Vincent</hi>) of his true father <hi>Lionel Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Arch-deacon</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and for ſome years Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> the ſon of Earl <hi>Rivers,</hi> and brother to <hi>Edward</hi> the Fourth's Queen; a Man, that, when by the death of divers brothers the Earldome fell to Him, moſt nobly leſt it to a younger brother. According to this man's excellency was the funeral of his natural ſon <hi>Stephen Gardiner:</hi> who leaving behind him 40000 marks in ready money, &amp; for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors, the <hi>Vicount Mountague,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Ely</hi> [as the worthy Biſhop <hi>Godwin</hi> in his <hi>Catalogue</hi> relates] had the happy honour to have his body, which was encloſed in lead, carried from St. <hi>Mary Overies</hi> Church [where it had continued in a vault about a quarter of a year] through <hi>Southwark</hi> to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> in a Chariot covered with black, having on it an Image lively repreſenting the perſon deceaſed, cloth'd in a Goap of Gold, with a Miter on the head, and all manner of Pontifical attire, his Great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutors attending the Corps with two hundred horſe: which, with the conſideration of the length of the journey, may rank it, though a late one, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Magnificent and Ancient ſolemnities.

For who may not ſee, that the ſpeech is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but figurative and ſo more elegant? his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe being to expreſs, that though his maſter and He were of different ages, and conſequently not born under the ſame conſtellation, yet their diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions might ſeem to have been derived from the ſame coeleſtial influences, as <hi>Horace</hi> feigned of himſelf and <hi>Mecanas.</hi> But one more material exception I may here move againſt our Author (though not obſerv'd by the Criticks) who, whiles he ſeems to approve of the Aſtrologers doctrines, may ſeem to forget himſelf, when in the Sixt Satyre he ſays —<hi>Geminos Horoſcope varo Producis Genio</hi>—; which is quite contrary to this aſſertion. Wherefore to reconcile theſe places, I think he ſpeaks thus in this place, rather to ſhew his ſkill, then his Beleif; and thus ſpeaks here according to the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but in the Sixt Satyre does in part reprehend, at leaſt weaken, that opinion. Wherefore in that place I render it, <hi>For Oft the ſame Birth-day Hath an Aſcendant ſtrangly influent Producing ev'n in twins a different, yea, an oppoſed Genius;</hi> mitigating ſo the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluteneſs of the ſpeech, though the particle of ſuch moderation, <hi>Oft</hi> (or <hi>ſometimes</hi>) be not expreſſely in the Poet. The <hi>Aſcendent</hi> is that part of heaven, which ariſes in the Eaſt in the moment, wherein a child is born: it is called the firſt houſe, containing 30. degrees; and the Aſtrologers obſerve in that point the poſiture of the coeleſtial conſtellations, that is, the ſtate of the Planets amongſt themſelves, as alſo the fixed ſtars, placing the ſaid planets and the ſigns of the <hi>Zodiack</hi> in a figure divided into 12 houſes, repreſenting the circumſerence of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the firſt of which is <hi>Angulus.

The Poet then in the
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:62892:177"/>Sixt Satyre ſays, it is no marvel, if they that are born under diverſe conſtellations have diverſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, when ſometimes (contrary to Aſtrologers) they that are born under the ſame <hi>Aſcerdent,</hi> have different diſpoſitions, one being covercous, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prodigal.

                        </gap>oreticks amongſt the Jews, which, as they ſay, held <hi>Herod</hi> the Great to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> becauſe at that time, he being a ſtranger, the Scepter was depamed from <hi>Judah,</hi> which was the time, according to propheſie, of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> his comming. But it may ſeem ſtrangly improbable, that any Jews, who were ſo acquainted with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophers, ſhould be ſo vain, as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain one not of the tribe of <hi>Judah,</hi> nay a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for their <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> to omit his cruelty in the ſlaughter of the Intants, and his odious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his own family. Beſides, that there were any ſuch Hereticks, is not ſufficiently prov'd; and ſome underſtand by the <hi>Herodians, Court Flatterers;</hi> others more particularly <hi>Herod's Souldiers. St. Jerom</hi> thinks them to be ſuch as ſtood earneſtly for the payment of tribute unto <hi>Caeſar. Pigworius</hi> takes them for <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi>'s <hi>Servants (de Servis, p.</hi> 41.) ſuch potentates of the World having vaſt multitudes of ſervants; and ſo the <hi>Herodians</hi> to be underſtood, <hi>Matt.</hi> 22. Others not finding, as they ſay, in ancient Authors any mention of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great his birth day, think it may rather be underſtood of <hi>Herod Antipas</hi> [the Son of <hi>Herod</hi> the Great] who upon his own birth-day, as the ſcripture teſtifies, cauſed St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> to be beheaded. But if we remember that ſeaſon, as it has been anciently obſerv'd by the Church [on the 24th. of <hi>June</hi>] they would ſcarce have cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated it, as our Poet deſcribes it, with <hi>violets.</hi> But the Inauguration of Kings is uſually but a temporary feſtival during their Raign, as likewiſe their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; as it was alſo amongſt the Heathen, being perform'd with Sacrifices to their <hi>Genius,</hi> which concern'd them not after death. Methinks they, who would here underſtand <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, might rather have remembred the <hi>Ludi Quinquennales,</hi> which were feſtivals dedicated by the Colledge of the <hi>Quindecùnviri,</hi> to the honour of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Judaea,</hi> by <hi>Herod,</hi> as <hi>Egeſippus</hi> witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Only againſt theſe feſtivals I may object, that theſe cannot ſo fitly be called <hi>Herodis dies,</hi> as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſti,</hi> to whoſe honour they were inſtituted. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this needful examination, to come nearer the deciſion of the buſineſs, we muſt chiefly conſider the intent of our Poet, who here reprehends, after other vices in the <hi>Romans,</hi> ſuperſtition, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> ſaying, that ſome were ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious, that they ſided with the <hi>Jews</hi> not only in their Sabbaths, but alſo in their Civil feſtivals, as in the Celebration of the birth-day, or the day of Inauguration of <hi>Herod</hi> King of <hi>Judas;</hi> and thus he ſeems to ſpeak of a Perſon in his own time, and a Rite then in practice. If then we look upon the race of the <hi>Herods,</hi> which bare rule in the Eaſtern parts at that time, we ſhall find a man, the laſt of that race in authority, in high favour with the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,</hi> in <hi>Perſius</hi> his time; a man alſo of ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent deſert, though a <hi>Herod,</hi> that he did with great felicity obtain much ſafety and favour for the Jews under diverſe Emperors, till their ſedition over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw them; although they requited his merits with ſome affronts. This man was the great Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child of <hi>Herod</hi> the great; from whom in order deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended <hi>Herod Antipas;</hi> from him <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> of whoſe horrible death we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. and from him this <hi>Herod,</hi> whom we intend, called by the ſame name <hi>Herod Agrippa,</hi> but by way of diſtinction com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly

And of this man I judge, that our Poet here ſpeaks, as of a buſineſs in his own time and ſight.

This that I have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated I take to be truth, and that it may not be defended, to ſay that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was before <hi>Homer,</hi> and ſo to ſay that <hi>Ennius</hi> was the fift from <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> Yet do I render it by the <hi>number,</hi> the fift from <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> and ſo againſt this Chronological truth, yet not without juſt reaſons, as ſhall appear. That this then is a truth, I grant: that <hi>Perſius</hi> intended this truth, I deny. For an Interpreter to retain the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of an Author, is not an errour: to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, is Truth and happineſs. Now that our Poet ſpeaks here according to opinion and vulgar errour, it may be probable from theſe conſiderations. Firſt, from the Affectation of the Expreſſion, if he ſpeak according to truth: for, to ſay that <hi>Ennius</hi> was of this judgment, after that <hi>Quintus</hi> had done dreaming that he
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:62892:180"/>was <hi>Homer</hi> (the Son of <hi>Maeon</hi>) ſeems to me a harſh and filling conſtruction. For, what a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and overplus is it, to ſay <hi>Ennius,</hi> and then preſently and unneceſſarily to call him <hi>Quintus;</hi> when as it had been ſufficient only to have ſaid, <hi>Cor jube<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For, was this the Opinion only of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius?</hi> of young <hi>Perſius</hi> and not of others alſo ſince his time? of others of greater practice and experience in ſtudy? If we conſult with the old Commentatour upon our Authour (<hi>Annaeus Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutus</hi> the <hi>Grammarian</hi>) does he not alleadge, that <hi>Ennius</hi> himſelf in the beginning of his <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals</hi> relates how he ſaw <hi>Homer</hi> in his dream, who told him that he was once a <hi>peacock,</hi> and that the form (or ſoul) of that bird paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, into him?

                        </gap>) And does he not add. Therefore it is ſaid <hi>quintus,</hi> becauſe of that opinion, which ſays, that the ſoul of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> paſſed into a <hi>Peacock,</hi> from the Peacock in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Euphorbus,</hi> from <hi>Euphorbus</hi> into <hi>Homer,</hi> from <hi>Homer</hi> into <hi>Ennius?</hi> Is not here clearly the ſame anachroniſme, and avouched as the mind of <hi>Perſius?</hi> Is it not alſo in <hi>Lactantius</hi> (as he is vuſgarly call'd) the Commentatour on <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius?</hi> who on the 3d. of the <hi>Thebais,</hi> has the ſame errour againſt Chronologie in reſpect of <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> though he ſomewhat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ordering the reſt, making the deſcent thus; <hi>Euphorbus, Pythagoras, pavus, Homerus, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</hi> Nay, does not <hi>Tertullian (lib. de reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione carnts)</hi> a <hi>Grande</hi> in learning, and one who lived within a hundred and fifty years after <hi>Perſius,</hi> place them in the ſame laſt recited or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der?

I may therefore ſay, that Truth made the Interpreters here miſtake, <hi>Quintus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Praenomen</hi> of <hi>Ennius.</hi> And therefore <hi>Stel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </hi> might have ſpar'd his exception in this place; as alſo before him <hi>Hieronymus Columna</hi> (on <hi>Ennius</hi> his <hi>Fragments</hi>) doubting of this order; 1 <hi>Pavo.</hi> 2 <hi>Euphorbus.</hi> 3 <hi>Pythagoras.</hi> 4 <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merus.</hi> 5 <hi>Ennius.</hi> Not for the leaſt want of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Judgment in his exception, but rather for the exactneſs. Wherefore I render this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage not according to truth, but according to <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> his mind: from whom to expect <hi>Chronological</hi> ſeverity, were more to erre from diſcretion, then he does from truth. Moreover, that <hi>Quintus</hi> here does <hi>not</hi> ſignifie a <hi>Name, but</hi> a <hi>Number,</hi> may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable from the receiv'd tradition of the <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans,</hi> mention'd by St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in his third Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie againſt <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> where he ſays, only with variation of the perſons, that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> beleiv'd, <hi>Se primum fuiſſe Euphorbum, ſecundo Callidem, tertio Hermotimum, quarto Pyrrbum, ad extremum Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goram;</hi> in like manner implying the <hi>ſame Number</hi> of changes. Concerning <hi>Ennius,</hi> whom our Poet here honours, I may add ſomewhat remarkable; <hi>Varro</hi> telling us <hi>(libr. de poetis)</hi> that he writ the 12th. book of his Annals, when he was 67. years of age. It is related of him alſo, that he liv'd to great Age and Poverty, which he did bear with a brave ſpirit; as alſo that he was buried in the monument of <hi>Scipie Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canus major,</hi> whoſe wars he writ; and had a ſtatue erected for him together with <hi>Scipio</hi>'s, as <hi>Livie</hi> tells, <hi>lib.</hi> 38. That little, which he had, he left to <hi>Pacuvius</hi> the Tragick Poet, his Siſter's, or as ſome ſay, his daughter's Son. See the learned <hi>Columna</hi> in his Life.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Signum—in lagenâ.</hi> A reprehenſion of the unworthy niggardlineſs of ſome of the ancients, who would ſeal-up even the dreggs of wine: yet in the times more ancient, as particularly in the <hi>Trojan</hi> times, <hi>Pliny</hi> (<hi>lib.</hi> 33. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.) tells us, there were no rings, uſing <hi>Homer</hi> as a witneſs; and ſays, that they tied knots for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, inſteed of fixing ſeals, upon their moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious goods. But this his opinion is rejected by <hi>Longus, de Annulis ſignatoriis, cap.</hi> 2. denying any ſuch thing to be in <hi>Homer;</hi> unleſs, as he ſays, <hi>Pliny</hi> did peradventure build his opinion upon the knots, which <hi>
